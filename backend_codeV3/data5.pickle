p2
(lp3
S"The curse placed on Oedipus lingers and haunts a younger generation in this new and brilliant translation of Sophocles' classic drama. The daughter of Oedipus and Jocasta, Antigone is an unconventional heroine who pits her beliefs against the King of Thebes in a bloody test of wills that leaves few unharmed. Emotions fly as she challenges the king for the right to bury her own brother. Determined but doomed, Antigone shows her inner strength throughout the play.<br /><br />Antigone raises issues of law and morality that are just as relevant today as they were more than two thousand years ago. Whether this is your first reading or your twentieth, Antigone will move you as few pieces of literature can.<br /><br />To make this quintessential Greek drama more accessible to the modern reader, this Prestwick House Literary Touchstone Edition includes a glossary of difficult terms, a list of vocabulary words, and convenient sidebar notes. By providing these, it is our intention that readers will more fully enjoy the beauty, wisdom, and intent of the play."

The Brothers Karamazov tells the stirring tale of four brothers: the pleasure-seeking, impatient Dmitri; the brilliant and morose Ivan; the gentle, loving, and honest Alyosha; and the illegitimate Smerdyakov: shy, silent, and cruel. The four unite in the murder of one of literature's most despicable characters--their father. While on the surface a story about patricide, this novel is, on a deeper level, a spiritual tale of the struggle between faith, doubt, reason, and free will.

When Morgoth, first Dark Lord, destroyed the Trees, that light lived on only in the Silmarils; Morgoth seized them and set them in his crown, guarded in the impenetrable fortress of Angband in the north of Middle-earth. <i>The Silmarillion</i> is the history of the rebellion of Feanor and his people against the gods, their exile in Middle-earth, and their war, hopeless despite all the heroisim of Elves and Men, against the great Enemy.<br /><br />The book includes several other, shorter works beside <i>The Silmarillion</i> proper. Preceding it are Ainulindale, the myth of Creation, and Valaquenta, in which the nature and powers of each of the gods is set forth. After <i>The Silmarillion</i> is Akallabeth, the story of the downfall of the great island kingdom of Numenor at the end of the Second Age; completing the volume is "Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age," in which the events of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> are treated in the manner of <i>The Silmarillion</i>.'

(lp103
S'<br />Gresham Sykes wrote the book at the height of the Cold War, motivated by the world\'s experience of fascism and communism to study the closest thing to a totalitarian system in American life: a maximum security prison. The book is remarkably short--just 150 pages--but bristles with ideas. Sykes argued that many of the psychological effects of modern prison are even more brutal than the physical cruelties of the past. The trauma of being designated one of the very worst human beings in the world left prisoners with lifelong scars. It also inspired solidarity among prisoners and fierce resistance to authorities as strategies for rejecting those who rejected them. His analysis called into question whether prisons genuinely were, as many believed, "total institutions," where every facet of life was rigidly controlled. Sykes showed that the stronger the bonds among prisoners, the more difficult it was for prison guards to run the prisons without finding ways of "accommodating" the prisoners.<br /><br />The book set the stage for Michel Foucault\'s "Discipline and Punish," among other works. Since it appeared in 1958, it has served society as an indispensable text in coming to terms with the nature of modern power.<br />'

In the novel, published in 1851 after sixteen months of writing, Herman Melville recounts the Promethean quest of Captain Ahab, who, having lost a leg in a earlier battle with White Whale, is determined to catch the beast and destroy it. By the time readers meet Ahab, he is a vengeful, crazed, and terror-provoking figure, for Moby Dick has come to represent for him all the evil in the world.<br /><p>The relentless voyage of Ahab and his crew, a finely etched group of weird and wonderful characters who seem both flesh-and-blood individuals and symbolic of the varying qualities of men, becomes a masterful drama of life at sea. The drama is made more fascinating by Melville's eloquent style-a combination of the journalistic, colloquial, and poetic-and the themes and subjects he pursues-whales and whaling; mean's need for love and comradeship; and the fury of Ahab for the whale.<br /></p><p>Through realistic storytelling, symbolic allegory, and allusive and figurative language, Melville achieves in <i>Moby-dick</i>a special intensity that readers will marvel at, and not soon forget.</p>"

The resulting gardens, both naturalistic and pioneering in their design and content, ranged from a Woodland Garden to a Thyme Lawn to a Vegetable Garden -- a microcosm, in short, that reflected the issues, pleasures, and problems encountered by any gardener in any garden.Pearson takes us through the months as he worked in this dynamic environment, sharing his gardening philosophy and exploring the seasons both practically and aesthetically. Here are lessons learned about pruning, sowing, and maintenance -- and quiet discoveries about color, perfume, light, and balance.<br /><br />Throughout, "A Year of Splendor" offers that rare thing: an enchanting tale of the dance between a person and a place, extraordinarily told.'

S"Virginia Medical Examiner Kay Scarpetta has a bloody puzzle on her hands: five headless, limbless cadavers in Ireland, plus four similar victims in a landfill back home. Is a serial butcher loose in Virginia? That's what the panicked public thinks, thanks to a local TV reporter who got the leaked news from her boyfriend, Scarpetta's vile rival, Investigator Percy Ring. But the butchered bodies are so many red herrings intended to throw idiots like Ring off the track. Instead of a run-of-the-mill serial killer, we're dealing with a shadowy figure who has plans involving mutant smallpox, mass murder, and messing with Scarpetta's mind by e-mailing her gory photos of the murder scenes, along with cryptic AOL chat-room messages. The coolest innovation: Scarpetta's gorgeous genius niece, Lucy, equips her with a DataGlove and a VPL Eyephone, and she takes a creepy virtual tour of the e-mailed crime scene.<br /><br /><i>Unnatural Exposure</i> boasts brisk storytelling, crackling dialogue, evocative prose about forensic-science sleuthing, and crisp character sketches, both of familiar characters like Scarpetta's gruff partner Pete Marino and bit players like the landfill employee falsely accused by Ring. Plus, let's face it: serial killers are old hat. Cornwell's most vivid villains are highly plausible backstabbing colleagues like Ring, who plots to destroy Lucy's FBI career by outing her as a lesbian. Some readers object to the rather abrupt ending, but, hey, it's less jarring than <i>Hannibal</i>'s, and it's the logical culmination of Cornwell's philosophy about human nature. To illuminate the novel's finale, read Cornwell's remarks on paranoia in her Amazon.com interview. <i>--Tim Appelo</i>"

After graduating college she makes a decision to change her life. She wants to be the daughter her parents have always wanted. Elise terminates all of her old friendships, dates and becomes engaged to a well-respected young man. For some reason her engagement wedges a gap between Elise and her younger sister. But Elise is too concerned with changing her life to fix things with her sister. Then Elise meets a young woman who makes her question the path she\'s chosen. As Elise fluctuates between conflicting emotions, her indecisiveness alienates her family and sends her sister on a path of destruction. A tragedy forces Elise to rethink her decisions and accept that she is the master of her fate. S. Stephens has written a mournful yet optimistic story about overcoming the pressures of society. She explores one woman\'s turmoil and the emotional havoc it caused in her life. The secondary characters were pivotal to the story, in their attitudes about people\'s views on alternative lifestyles. The writing, characterizations and pace of the story are good.

S'<i>The Wounded Healer</i> is a hope-filled and profoundly simple book that speaks directly to those men and women who want to be of service in their church or community, but have found the traditional ways often threatening and ineffective. In this book, Henri Nouwen combines creative case studies of ministry with stories from diverse cultures and religious traditions in preparing a new model for ministry. Weaving keen cultural analysis with his psychological and religious insights, Nouwen has come up with a balanced and creative theology of service that begins with the realization of fundamental woundedness in human nature. Emphasizing that which is in humanity common to both minister and believer, this woundedness can serve as a source of strength and healing when counseling others. Nouwen proceeds to develop his approach to ministry with an analysis of sufferings -- a suffering world, a suffering generation, a suffering person, and a suffering minister. It is his contention that ministers are called to recognize the sufferings of their time in their own hearts and make that recognition the starting point of their service. For Nouwen, ministers must be willing to go beyond their professional role and leave themselves open as fellow human beings with the same wounds and suffering -- in the image of Christ. In other words, we heal from our own wounds. Filled with examples from everyday experience, The Wounded Healer is a thoughtful and insightful guide that will be welcomed by anyone engaged in the service of others.'

The people ruled, and little could stop them. If they ignored national boundaries, if they trampled the rights of indigenous peoples and of imported bondsmen, if they waged war for motives that started from base self-interest, all this came with the territory of democracy, a realm inhabited by ordinarily imperfect men and women. The one saving grace of democracy--the one that made all the difference in the end--was that sooner or later, sometimes after a terrible strife, democracy corrected its worst mistakes.""<br />--from "Lone Star Nation" <br />"Lone Star Nation" is the gripping story of Texas\'s precarious journey to statehood, from its early colonization in the 1820s to the shocking massacres of Texas loyalists at the Alamo and Goliad by the Mexican army, from its rough-and-tumble years as a land overrun by the Comanches to its day of liberation as an upstart republic. H. W. Brands tells the turbulent story of Texas through the eyes of a colorful cast of characters who have become a permanent fixture in the American landscape: Stephen Austin, the state\'s reluctant founder; Sam Houston, the alcoholic former governor who came to lead the Texas army in its hour of crisis and glory; William Travis, James Bowie, and David Crockett, the unforgettable heroic defenders of the doomed Alamo; Santa Anna, the Mexican "generalissimo" and dictator whose ruthless tactics galvanized the colonists against him; and thewhite-haired President Andrew Jackson whose expansionist aspirations loomed large in the background. Beyond these luminaries, Brands unearths the untold stories of the forgotten Texans--the slaves, women, unknown settlers, and children left out of traditional histories--who played crucial roles in Texas\'s birth. By turns bloody and heroic, tragic and triumphant, this riveting history of one of our greatest states reads like the most compelling fiction, and further secures H. W.

S'Lolita (1955), Nabokov\'s single most famous work, is one of the most controversial and widely read books of its time. Funny, satiric, poignant, filled with allusions to earlier American writers, it is the "confession" of a middle-aged, sophisticated European emigre\'s passionate obsession with a 12-year-old American "nymphet," and the story of their wanderings across a late 1940s America of highways and motels. Pnin (1957) is a comic masterpiece about a gentle bald Russian emigre professor in an American college town who is never quite able to master its language, its politics, or its train schedule. Pale Fire (1962) is a tour de force in the form of an ostensibly autobiographical poem by a recently deceased American poet and a critical commentary by an academic who is something other than what he seems. The texts of this volume incorporate Nabokov\'s penciled corrections in his own copies of his works and correct long-standing errors. They are the most authoritative versions available and have been prepared with the assistance of Dmitri Nabokov, the novelist\'s son, and Brian Boyd, Nabokov\'s award-winning biographer, who has also contributed notes and a detailed chronology of the author\'s life based on new research.'

S"Though all but three of Robert Sidney's 332 extant letters to his wife Barbara Gamage Sidney have been in the Sidney family archive, they have never previously been fully transcribed or edited. This edition of the surviving letters, which Sidney wrote to his wife when they were separated for long periods by his official duties at various continental locations, provides a wealth of information about the Sidneys' family life. They touch on matters such as family illnesses, the children's education, court gossip, finances, and the construction of additions to Penshurst Place, the seat of the Sidney family. The letters also offer an extraordinary record of an early-modern English household in which the wife was entrusted with the overall responsibility for the well-being of her family, and for managing a large estate in the absence of her husband. Sidney's letters show that, although his union with the wealthy Welsh heiress Barbara Gamage may have been engineered primarily for political and financial ends, clearly the couple enjoyed a happy and loving marriage. Their correspondence is full of endearments, and Robert frequently tells his wife how much he misses her and their beloved children, including his 'Malkin, ' later Lady Mary Wroth. The volume includes an introduction and notes by the editors. It also includes contextual materials such as relevant sections on family matters from letters to Robert from his trusted agent, Rowland Whyte; and from Robert Sidney's own business correspondence. The introduction specifically addresses the issue of Barbara's literacy, within the broader context of late-Elizabethan women's literacy."

Strategy, whether in war, sports or business, is about how one can place themselves in a competitive position that gives them an advantage over competitors. If that position can be made so overwhelming by one competitor that others are effectively taken out of effective competition, that competitor is dominant. Dominance wins. The game is over. Everyone else is playing for second place or lower. Creating Dominance describes how successful law firms have gone about dominating their marketplaces - be they a practice area, a city or an industry. The book begins by describing the characteristics that identify a dominant firm and the precise strategies law firms can use to put themselves in a position of dominance.'

If these are questions that leave you wondering then David Dodd\'s <i>The Complete Annotated Grateful Dead Lyrics</i> may just be the skeleton key you\'ve been looking for. Every Deadhead knows there is something profound hidden within their lyrics, even if most of the nuances go by unnoticed. Why are the obscure tales of their characters\' (Jack Straw, Black Peter, August West, et al) trials and tribulations on the psychedelic Americana landscape so intriguing? What is the deal with the reoccurring imagery that popped in and out of their songs for decades (the crows, light and darkness, rolling rivers, gambling, playing cards, space, and, of course, roses)? It is clear the Grateful Dead\'s lyricists Robert Hunter and John Barlow tapped into the well of the collective subconscious for material, but rarely were any explanations provided. Fans were basically on their own to put the pieces together themselves, until now. <p> <i>The Complete Annotated Grateful Dead Lyrics</i> began as a research project for David Dodd while he was working at the University of Colorado. Like many fans before him, Dodd spent hours passionately trying to find the deeper meanings in the Dead\'s songs. In 1994 the Internet may have been in its infancy, but Dodd knew the Web was the perfect to tool to help him annotate the entire Dead catalog. So began the building of his incredibly popular Web site. The fruits of his labors lie within the pages of this encyclopedic book. Where Robert Hunter\'s <i>A Box of Rain</i> only includes his lyrical contributions to the Dead\'s catalog, Dodd\'s book is expanded to include John Barlow\'s songs, as well as tunes the Dead covered so many times they became their own. It is worth mentioning, this book should not be viewed as a cheat sheet, but a tool giving lots of background and cross-references. The interpretations are still up to you. Be forewarned, this book can be extremely habit forming. <i>--Rob Bracco</i></p>'

It looks at the roles of women in the Bible and how those roles are defined or redefined in The Secret Life of Bees, expanding our concepts of the "Divine mother," earthly mothers, sisters, daughters, wives, and the "queen bee." Along the way, we encounter remembrance, forgiveness, reconciliation, liberation, community, rituals, the feminine face of God, and the important role women play in one another\'s lives.

(lp451
S'Gattungsfragen spielen in Arbeiten zur modernen englischen Dichtung selten eine Rolle - zu Unrecht, wie die vorliegende Studie am Beispiel der Elegie demonstriert. In diesem Genre findet seit der Antike die menschliche Grunderfahrung der Trauer ihren literarischen Ort. Trauerarbeit als aktive Uberwindung eines Verlusts wird im elegischen Gedicht im Fortschreiten von Klage zu Trost reprasentiert und so sinnfallig gemacht. Die modernen englischen Elegiker stehen den tradierten Formen, Trostmustern und Konventionen kritisch gegenuber, doch sie streben auch nach kreativer Erneuerung im Dialog mit der Geschichte des Genres und mit seinen klassischen Vertretern (Milton, Gray, Shelley). Die Elegie erweist sich somit als eminent selbstreflexive Gattung; dies zeigen die eingehenden Analysen der Dichtungen von Thomas Hardy, Peter Porter, Tony Harrison und Douglas Dunn, die den Schwerpunkt der Arbeit bilden."'

But what has remained unclear is whether she escapes from the forms of power that she opposes. Antigone proves to be a more ambivalent figure for feminism than has been acknowledged, since the form of defiance she exemplifies also leads to her death. Butler argues that Antigone represents a form of feminist and sexual agency that is fraught with risk. Moreover, Antigone shows how the constraints of normative kinship unfairly decide what will and will not be a liveable life."

News of the discovery of the Ice Man and his age, which was put at over five thousand years old, fascinated the world. But what made the story particularly extraordinary was that Professor Sykes was also able to track down a living genetic relative of the Ice Man, a woman living in Britain today.<br />How was he able to locate a living relative of a man who died thousands of years ago? In The Seven Daughters of Eve, Bryan Sykes gives us a first hand account of his research into a remarkable gene which passes undiluted from generation to generation through the maternal line and shows how it is being used to track our genetic ancestors through time and space. After plotting thousands of DNA sequences from all over the world he found that they had clustered around a handful of distinct groups. In Europe there are only seven. The conclusion: almost everyone of native European descent, wherever they live in the world, can trace their ancestry back to one of seven women, the Seven Daughters of Eve. He has named them Ursula, Xenia, Helena, Velda, Tara, Katrine and Jasmine.<br />In this remarkable scientific adventure story we learn exactly how our origins can be traced, how and where our ancient genetic ancestors lived, what their lives were like and how we are each living proof of the almost miraculous strength of our DNA which has survived and prospered over so many thousands of years to reach us today. It is a book that not only presents the story of our evolution in a wholly new light, but also strikes right at the heart of ourselves as individuals and of our sense of identity.'

S'The official inside story on the making of the award-winning movie trilogy<br /><br />The Lord of the Rings: The Making of the Movie Trilogy is a lavishly illustrated, behind-the-scenes, definitive account of the creation of an epic film experience. Hailed by critics worldwide, part one of the movie trilogy was a box-office smash, one of the most successful films of the decade. Peter Jackson\'s "fierce, imaginative movie takes high-flying risks and inspires with its power and scale," wrote Newsweek. "In every way this is moviemaking on a grand scale," wrote the San Francisco Chronicle, while Time proclaimed the "grandeur, moral heft and emotional depth" of the film, which received thirteen Academy Award(R) nominations. Including more than 300 photographs from all three films, most unique to this book, and exclusive interviews with all the cast and crew, Brian Sibley\'s fascinating book takes every fan inside the process of adapting J.R.R. Tolkien\'s masterwork for the screen. For the first time in history, three major movies were made at the same time, a triumphant and monumental undertaking that took the world by storm. Here can be found details about the hundreds of dedicated artists, craftspeople and cast and crew members who labored for years -- adding authenticity at every stage -- to bring one of the greatest stories ever told to an eager film audience. Sibley takes us inside the process of filmmaking to show us how the magic is made -- from the director, writers and actors to wardrobe, makeup, miniatures, music and digital special effects, it\'s all here.<br /><br />"It was tiring, physically and mentally, but never dull. Three movies, one big story, and so much variety: one day shooting scenes of intimate heart-wrenching drama, the next, vast battle scenes involving hundreds of extras. Every day brought an opportunity to create something new on this enormous canvas that is The Lord of the Rings." -- Peter Jackson'

Sarah Brophy outlines the critical framework for interpreting the emphasis on unresolved grief in the emerging body of work.<br /><br />Brophy challenges the tendency to treat AIDS testimonial literature as a genre particular to gay men. By examining Kincaid's and Hoffman's memoirs, in conjunction with the diaries of Michaels and Jarman, Brophy expands the territory of mourning beyond one group of people, an exercise that Brophy feels is important -- as well as fundamental -- to understanding the depth of personal grief and the ways we respond to grief in literature.<br /><br />In a clear and accessible style, <i>Witnessing AIDS</i> illustrates how memoirs and diaries are used as self-theorizing documents that approach personal testimony as an intervention in cultural memory. The aim of Brophy's work is to develop a framework for reading, one that begins to grasp the significance of unresolved grief in AIDS, its effect upon testimonial writing, and to engage rather than deflect. Visceral investment in the mundane intimacies of illness, death, and grief resituates a number of critical debates at new and provocative intersections as the strategy for understanding continues."

As its most important and influential female star, she dynamically pushed down the barriers that had previously prevented black entertainers from reaching mass recognition. The astounding media attention she received on both sides of the Atlantic during her two-year starring role in Lew Leslie's Broadway revue Blackbirds of 1928 turned Adelaide into what can only be termed the first modern-day international black female superstar.With fame came controversy. On Broadway, Adelaide's performance incited a riot. After purchasing an exclusive estate in the predominantly white suburb of Larchmont in Westchester, New York, the segregation and persecution she encountered from her racist neighbors hit national headlines.In Underneath a Harlem Moon, Williams takes the reader on a fascinating roller-coaster ride from Adelaide's birth in Brooklyn through her humble childhood in Harlem, from her triumphs on Broadway to the glamour of Paris's Moulin Rouge. Readers get a glimpse inside the most sophisticated and celebrated nightclubs in the world and follow Adelaide across two continents on a groundbreaking eighteen-month RKO tour. By the end of 1932, Adelaide had performed for millions and in the process had become one of America's wealthiest black women. Her exile to Paris in 1935 brought with it new challenges and rewards. By 1938, not content with being dubbed the Queen of Montmartre, she set her sights on conquering Britain. Underneath a Harlem Moon concludes with Adelaide's mysterious disappearance in November 1938, which has, until now, never been publicly explained."

Busted as a teenager for selling acid in the summer of 1968, Parish landed in Riker's Island. The experience changed him and after getting out he did his best to stay out of trouble, securing a job moving music equipment at the New York State Pavilion. The first show he worked was a Grateful Dead concert in July of 1969 and Parish was captivated by the music. A life seemingly headed nowhere had suddenly found its calling as he fell in quickly with a band of likeminded misfits who formed the nucleus of what would be the greatest road crew in rock 'n' roll history.<br /><br />Parish traveled to California where his apprenticeship began. Working for the band for free and learning his craft, Parish got to know Jerry, Bobby, Phil, Billy and Mickey and through the years their relationships forged an unbreakable bond. He became very close with Garcia in particular, acting as his personal roadie and later manager for his solo performances and Garcia Band shows. He was there during times of trouble (like when a pimp held Garcia hostage at gunpoint in a New York hotel room), spending hours by his bedside when Garcia was in a coma in 1986, and performing the duties of best man at his wedding. He was also the last friend to see Garcia alive. <br /><br />Throughout the Dead's historic run, there were parties of biblical proportion and celebrity run-ins with everybody from Bob Dylan to Frank Sinatra--but there was a dark side to life on the road and tragedy didn't just strike the musicians.<br /><br />But <i>Home Before Daylight</i> is a story of friendship, of music and redemption. It is a piece of music history, one that reflects the American spirit of adventure and brotherhood. Seen through Steve Parish's eyes and experiences, The Grateful Dead's wild ride has never been so revealing.<br />"

And what we discover when we return to the original is very simply a classic, a work whose uncompromising worth has not paled since it first saw the light of day in 1934.<br /><br />The original words of Benjamin Graham and David Dodd--put to paper not long after the disastrous Stock Market Crash of 1929--still have the mesmerizing qualities of rigorous honesty and diligent scrutiny, the same riveting power of disciplined thought and determined logic that gave the work its first distinction and began its illustrious career.<br /><br />The words you will read here are eloquent. Not only a financial genius and a man of high repute for honorable dealings, Graham was a man of letters invited to teach in the literature department at Columbia University (as well as in the economics and philosophy departments).<br /><br />But this reproduction is far more than a historical curiosity, an interesting object, and a delightful read. It presents the original Graham/Dodd method of investing--told in their own words as they first described it in the 1930s.<br /><br />What exactly is this method that has drawn such longterm devotion in the notably fickle reaches of Wall Street?<br /><br />Graham and Dodd were Wall Street\'s first bargain shoppers. In this book they first explain their methods for locating bonds and stocks "which are selling well below the levels apparently justified by a careful analysis of the relevant facts." In this book, they tell you precisely how to find these undervalued securities and analyze those "relevant facts."<br /><br />Are these methods still practical and usable today? The great fortunes created by value investors Warren Buffett, Mario Gabelli, John Neff, Michael Price, and John Bogle testify that they certainly are.<br /><br />In their preface to this book, Graham and Dodd write that they hope their work "will stand the test of the ever enigmatic future." There is no doubt that it has.<br /><br />"This distinctively wrought book is a careful reproduction of the 1934 edition, containing every word of the original."'

At age twenty-three, he woke up on a plane to find his four front teeth had been knocked out. His nose was broken and there was a hole through his cheek. He had no idea where the plane was headed or what had happened over the preceding two weeks. He had been an alcoholic for ten years and a crack addict for three. When he checked into a treatment facility shortly thereafter, he was told he could either stop using or die before he reached twenty-four. This is Frey's acclaimed account of his six weeks in rehab; fiercely honest and deeply affecting, it is one of the most graphic and immediate books ever to be written about addiction and recovery."

During the divorce proceedings, he and Evelyn signed a child custody bond, and Steven is demanding the money guaranteed by the bond to find Annie. The money was secured by a mortgage on Evelyn's grandmother's house, and the True Blue Bonds Bail Agency wants to take possession of the house.<br /><br />Finding a kidnapped child is not an assignment for a bounty hunter. But Evelyn's grandmother lives next door to Stephanie's parents, and Stephanie's mother and grandmother are not about to see their neighbor lose her house because of abduction.<br /><br />Even though Stephanie's plate is full with miscreants who missed their court dates, including old nemesis and violent drunk Andy Bender and an elusive little old lady accused of grand theft auto, she can't disappoint Grandma Mazur! So she follows the trail left by Annie and Evelyn-- and finds a lot more than she bargained for. Steven is somehow linked with a very scary Eddie Abruzzi. Trenton cop and on-again, off-again fiance Joe Morelli and Stephanie's mentor and tormentor, Ranger, warn Stephanie about Abruzzi, but it's Abruzzi's eyes and mannerisms that frighten Stephanie the most. Stephanie needs Ranger's savvy and expertise, and she's willing to accept his help to find Annie even though it might mean becoming too involved with Ranger.<br /><br />Stephanie, Ranger, Lula (who's not going to miss riding with Ranger), and Evelyn's lawyer/laundromat manager set out to find Annie. The search turns out to be a race among Stephanie's posse, the True Blue Bonds' agent, a Rangerette known as Jeanne Ellen Burrows, and the Abruzzi crew. Not to mention the fact that there's a killer rabbit on the loose!<br /><br />Strap on your helmet and get ready for the ride of your life. Hard Eight. The world of Plum has never been wilder."

This celebratory volume, published on the occasion of the Nobel laureate's 90th birthday, brings together a selection of the more personal, reflective pieces that have appeared over the past seven years. They reveal a writer concerned as always with the human condition, with his own thought processes, and with the craft of writing, offering rare insights into the way a great writer thinks and works. The range and quality of writing is even more remarkable when one remembers that since a nearly fatal knife attack in 1994, the injuries Mahfouz sustained, combined with his failing eyesight, have made it almost impossible for him to write. But as a man who has devoted his life to the written word, Mahfouz now prepares his weekly articles through conversations with his friend Mohamed Salmawy, who has selected and gathered the pieces in this collection. Mahfouz fans and anyone interested in learning more about the life, times, and thoughts of one of the major figures of modern Arabic literature will find this volume an essential addition to their bookshelf."

S'In <i>Cultural Locations of Disability,</i> Sharon L. Snyder and David T. Mitchell trace how disabled people came to be viewed as biologically deviant. The eugenics era pioneered techniques that managed "defectives" through the application of therapies, invasive case histories, and acute surveillance techniques, turning disabled persons into subjects for a readily available research pool. In its pursuit of normalization, eugenics implemented disability regulations that included charity systems, marriage laws, sterilization, institutionalization, and even extermination. Enacted in enclosed disability locations, these practices ultimately resulted in expectations of segregation from the mainstream, leaving today\'s disability politics to focus on reintegration, visibility, inclusion, and the right of meaningful public participation.<br /><br />Snyder and Mitchell reveal cracks in the social production of human variation as aberrancy. From our modern obsessions with tidiness and cleanliness to our desire to attain perfect bodies, notions of disabilities as examples of human insufficiency proliferate. These disability practices infuse more general modes of social obedience at work today. Consequently, this important study explains how disabled people are instrumental to charting the passage from a disciplinary society to one based upon regulation of the self.'

In the spring of 1999 and 2000 and the fall of 2001, Smith and Chamlee shipped their old Land Rover to Europe, a vehicle they configured to accommodate their large-format camera equipment and camping gear. They then drove to Italy, where they traveled together, yet worked separately while exploring the landscape and the small towns and villages of Tuscany each recording their own visual responses to a land they had come to love. Their photographs are the culmination of those three extensive trips: from the quarries in the Carrara region in the north to the old Etruscan towns in the south and from the Val di Chiana and Cortona in the east to the Island of Elba off the coast to the west. Their photographs are full of warmth and life, yet demanding in their complex visual elements. Selections from each of the photographers are here collected in this extraordinary two-volume set of books. Volume I contains Chamlee's 8x10, 5x7 and 4x5-inch photographs, along with an essay by the distinguished Curator of Photography, Robert Sobieszek, a foreword by the noted writer, Ferenc Mate and a preface by photographers.

S'Whether they see themselves as King of the Wild Things or protector of Toto, children live in a world filled with animals--both real and imaginary. From Black Beauty to Barney, animal characters romp through children\'s books, cartoons, videos, and computer games. As Gail Melson tells us, more than three-quarters of all children in America live with pets and are now more likely to grow up with a pet than with both parents. She explores not only the therapeutic power of pet-owning for children with emotional or physical handicaps but also the ways in which zoo and farm animals, and even certain purple television characters, become confidants or teachers for children--and sometimes, tragically, their victims.<br /><br />Yet perhaps because animals are ubiquitous, what they really mean to children, for better and for worse, has been unexplored territory. "Why the Wild Things Are" is the first book to examine children\'s many connections to animals and to explore their developmental significance. What does it mean that children\'s earliest dreams are of animals? What is the unique gift that a puppy can give to a boy? Drawing on psychological research, history, and children\'s media, "Why the Wild Things Are" explores the growth of the human-animal connection. In chapters on children\'s emotional ties to their pets, the cognitive challenges of animal contacts, animal symbols as building blocks of the self, and pointless cruelty to animals, Melson shows how children\'s innate interest in animals is shaped by their families and their social worlds, and may in turn shape the kind of people they will become.'

Here in the wondrously strange "neighborhood" of Manhattan we observe the triumphs and travails of father, mother, son, and daughter; and of the teachers, coaches, therapists, adversaries, and friends who round out the extended urban family. From Bluie, a goldfish fated to meet a Hitchcockian end, to Charlie Ravioli, an imaginary playmate who, being a New Yorker, is too busy to play, the Gopniks\' new home is under the spell of the sort of characters only the city\'s unique civilization of childhood could produce. <br />Not long after their return, the fabric of living will be rent by the events of 9/11, but like a magic garment will reweave itself, reviving normalcy in a world where Jewish jokes mingle with debates about the problem of consciousness, the price of real estate, and the meaning of modern art. Along the way, the impermanence and transcendence of life will be embodied in the person of a beloved teacher and coach who, even facing death, radiates a distinctively local light. <br />Written with Gopnik\'s signature mix of mind and heart, elegant and exultantly alert to the minute miracles that bring a place to life, "Through the Children\'s Gate" is a chronicle, by turns tender and hilarious, of a family taking root in the unlikeliest patch of earth.'

In this novel, Edwar al-Kharrat has created a unique form of narrative discourse in which he presents Egyptian realities and actualities of the 1960s and 1970s, with flashbacks to as early as the 1940s, in an aesthetic form that highlights historical moments while blending philosophical, mythical, and psychological perspectives in a literary parallel to the cinematic technique of montage. In their citation awarding al-Kharrat the Mahfouz Medal, the judges stated: ''Rama and the Dragon is considered a breakthrough in the literary history of modern Arabic fiction.''"

His job was to convince countries that are strategically important to the United States, from Indonesia to Panama, to accept enormous loans for infrastructure development, and to make sure that the lucrative projects were contracted to US corporations, such as Halliburton and Bechtel. Saddled with huge debts, these countries came under the control of the US government, World Bank, and other US-dominated aid agencies that acted like loan sharks, dictating repayment terms and bullying foreign governments into submission. Confessions of an Economic Hit Man is the story of one man's extraordinary experiences inside the international intrigue, greed, corruption, and little-known government and corporate activities that America has been involved in since World War II--and which have dire implications for American democracy and world freedom."

Words are useful signposts, Eckhart begins, but our main spiritual teacher is stillness. This powerful energy field is always available to us through meditation. In simple language, he explains how to listen with your entire body while working with the body, mind, and attention in order to merge with this moment. As we go beyond the need for thought, he teaches, we achieve the meditative state of no mind or presence that is effortless, joyful, and natural. Through this timeless path we merge with the universal purpose, and become a divine presence. A revolution in human consciousness has already started, teaches Eckhart Tolle.

(lp923
S'On December 18, 1999, Julia Butterfly Hill\'s feet touched the ground for the first time in over two years, as she descended from "Luna," a thousandyear-old redwood in Humboldt County, California.<br /><br />Hill had climbed 180 feet up into the tree high on a mountain on December 10, 1997, for what she thought would be a two- to three-week-long "tree-sit." The action was intended to stop Pacific Lumber, a division of the Maxxam Corporation, from the environmentally destructive process of clear-cutting the ancient redwood and the trees around it. The area immediately next to Luna had already been stripped and, because, as many believed, nothing was left to hold the soil to the mountain, a huge part of the hill had slid into the town of Stafford, wiping out many homes.<br /><br />Over the course of what turned into an historic civil action, Hill endured El Nino storms, helicopter harassment, a ten-day siege by company security guards, and the tremendous sorrow brought about by an old-growth forest\'s destruction. This story--written while she lived on a tiny platform eighteen stories off the ground--is one that only she can tell.<br /><br />Twenty-five-year-old Julia Butterfly Hill never planned to become what some have called her--the Rosa Parks of the environmental movement. Shenever expected to be honored as one of <em>Good Housekeeping\'s</em> "Most Admired Women of 1998" and <em>George</em> magazine\'s "20 Most Interesting Women in Politics," to be featured in <em>People</em> magazine\'s "25 Most Intriguing People of the Year" issue, or to receive hundreds of letters weekly from young people around the world. Indeed, when she first climbed into Luna, she had no way of knowing the harrowing weather conditions and the attacks on her and her cause. She had no idea of the loneliness she would face or that her feet wouldn\'t touch ground for more than two years. She couldn\'t predict the pain of being an eyewitness to the attempted destruction of one of the last ancient redwood forests in the world, nor could she anticipate the immeasurable strength she would gain or the life lessons she would learn from Luna. Although her brave vigil and indomitable spirit have made her a heroine in the eyes of many, Julia\'s story is a simple, heartening tale of love, conviction, and the profound courage she has summoned to fight for our earth\'s legacy.'

The appearance of the Knight Templar was also changed; and, though less studiously bedecked with ornament, his dress was as rich, and his appearance far more commanding, than that of his companion. He had exchanged his shirt of mail for an under tunic of dark purple silk, garnished with furs, over which flowed his long robe of spotless white, in ample folds. The eight-pointed cross of his order was cut on the shoulder of his mantle in black velvet. The high cap no longer invested his brows, which were only shaded by short and thick curled hair of a raven blackness, corresponding to his unusually swart complexion.

The perfect day turns to nightmare, however, when they are involved in freak ballooning accident in which a boy is saved but a man is killed. In itself, the accident would change the couple and the survivors\' lives, filling them with an uneasy combination of shame, happiness, and endless self-reproach. But fate has far more unpleasant things in store for Joe. Meeting the eye of fellow rescuer Jed Parry, for example, turns out to be a very bad move. For Jed is instantly obsessed, making the first of many calls to Joe and Clarissa\'s London flat that very night. Soon he\'s openly shadowing Joe and writing him endless letters. (One insane epistle begins, "I feel happiness running through me like an electrical current. I close my eyes and see you as you were last night in the rain, across the road from me, with the unspoken love between us as strong as steel cable.") Worst of all, Jed\'s version of love comes to seem a distortion of Joe\'s feelings for Clarissa. <p> Apart from the incessant stalking, it is the conditionals--the contingencies--that most frustrate Joe, a scientific journalist. If only he and Clarissa had gone straight home from the airport... If only the wind hadn\'t picked up... If only he had saved Jed\'s 29 messages in a single day... Ian McEwan has long been a poet of the arbitrary nightmare, his characters ineluctably swept up in others\' fantasies, skidding into deepening violence, and--worst of all--becoming strangers to those who love them. Even his prose itself is a masterful and methodical exercise in de-familiarisation. But <i>Enduring Love</i> and its underrated predecessor, <i>Black Dogs</i>, are also meditations on knowledge and perception as well as brilliant manipulations of our own expectations. By the novel\'s end, you will be surprisingly unafraid of hot-air balloons, but you won\'t be too keen on looking a stranger in the eye. --<i>Alex Freeman</i></p>'

Made of rice paper, at once ingenious and deadly, they sailed thousands of miles across the Pacific...and once they started landing, the U.S. scrambled teams to find and defuse them, and then keep them secret from an already anxious public. Eighteen-year-old Louis Belk was one of those men. Dispatched to the Alaskan frontier, young Sergeant Belk was better trained in bomb disposal than in keeping secrets. And the mysteries surrounding his mission only increased when he met his superior officer--a brutal veteran OSS spy hunter who knew all too well what the balloons could do--and Lily, a Yup\'ik Eskimo woman who claimed she could see the future. <br />Louis\'s superior ushers him into a world of dark secrets; Lily introduces Louis to an equally disorienting world of spirits--and desire. But the world that finally tests them all is Alaska, whose vastness cloaks mysteries that only become more frightening as they unravel. Chasing after the ghostly floating weapons, Louis embarks upon an adventure that will lead him deep into the tundra. There, on the edge of the endless wilderness, he will make a discovery and a choice that will change the course of his life. <br />At once a heart-quickening mystery and a unique love story, "The Cloud Atlas" is also a haunting, lyrical rendering of a little-known chapter in history.

It's the fictionalized story of a real nineteenth-century English colony near Fairmont, Minnesota, located near Maud Lovelace's hometown of Mankato.<br /><br />Tales of the immigrant British men and women, striving to recreate English country estates on the Minnesota prairie, intrigued the Lovelaces. The authors' thorough research became the basis for this vivid novel of colorful fox hunts, festive balls, and English family life set on the huge bean farms bought from a land speculator."

S"The Book of Lost Tales was the first major work of imagination by J.R.R. Tolkien, begun in 1916-17 when he was twenty-five years old and left incomplete several years later. It stands at the beginning of the entire conception of Middle-earth and Valinor, for these tales were the first form of the myths and legends that came to be called The Silmarillion. Embedded in English legend, they are set in the narrative frame of a great westward voyage over the Ocean by a mariner named Eriol (or AElfwine) to Tol Eressea, the Lonely Isle, where elves dwelt; from him they learned their true history, the Lost Tales of Elfinesse. In these Tales are found the earliest accounts and original ideas of Gods and Elves, Dwarves, Balrogs, and Orcs; of the Silmarils and the Two Trees of Valinor; of Nargothrond and Gondolin; of the geography and cosmology of Middle-earth. Volume One contains the tales of The Music of the Ainur, The Building of valinor, The Chaining of Melko, The coming of the Elves and The Flight of the Noldoli, among others. Each tale is followed by a short essay by Christopher Tolkien, the author's son and literary executor."

The trilogy, however, is more than a journey into the past. Undset's own life--her familiarity with Norse sagas and folklore and with a wide range of medieval literature, her experiences as a daughter, wife, and mother, and her deep religious faith--profoundly influenced her writing. Her grasp of the connections between past and present and of human nature itself, combined with the extraordinary quality of her writing, sets her works far above the genre of -historical novels.- This new translation by Tina Nunnally--the first English version since Charles Archer's translation in the 1920s--captures Undset's strengths as a stylist. Nunnally, an award-winning translator, retains the natural dialog and lyrical flow of the original Norwegian, with its echoes of Old Norse legends, while deftly avoiding the stilted language and false archaisms of Archer's translation. In addition, she restores key passages left out of that edition.Undset's ability to present a meticulously accurate historical portrait without sacrificing the poetry and narrative drive of masterful storytelling was particularly significant in her homeland. Granted independence in 1905 after five hundred years of foreign domination, Norway was eager to reclaim its national history and culture. <i>Kristin Lavransdatter</i> became a touchstone for Undset's contemporaries, and continues to be widely read by Norwegians today. In the more than 75 years since it was first published, it has also become a favorite throughout the world. <br />For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

Now Peter Kuper has created a graphic version of the story in which Kuper's kinetic art is the perfect complement to the intensity of Kafka's prose. Rather than merely illustrating the story, Kuper animates it with new life and meaning, powerfully reinforcing its themes of isolation, anxiety, and alienation in a dehumanized modern world. This graphic treatment draws out the subtle psychological and emotional shifts of the story, while also capturing Kafka's often unrecognized humor. Peter Kuper's The Metamorphosis will exert an irresistible appeal to fans of graphic novels like Art Spiegelman's Maus and Chris Ware's jimmy Corrigan, and to anyone curious about a new interpretation of a modern literary classic."

p1230
(lp1231
S"No matter when or where they are fought, all wars have one thing in common: a relentless progression to monuments and memorials for the dead. Likewise all art made from war begins and ends in mourning and remembrance. In <i>The Mourner's Song</i>, James Tatum offers incisive discussions of physical and literary memorials constructed in the wake of war, from the Vietnam Veterans Memorial to the writings of Stephen Crane, Edmund Wilson, Tim O'Brien, and Robert Lowell.<br /><br />Tatum's touchstone throughout is the <i>Iliad</i>, not just one of the earliest war poems, but also one of the most powerful examples of the way poetry can be a tribute to and consolation for what is lost in war. Reading the <i>Iliad</i> alongside later works inspired by war, Tatum reveals how the forms and processes of art convert mourning to memorial. He examines the role of remembrance and the distance from war it requires; the significance of landscape in memorialization; the artifacts of war that fire the imagination; the intimate relationship between war and love and its effects on the ferocity with which soldiers wage battle; and finally, the idea of memorialization itself. Because all survivors suffer the losses of war, Tatum's is a story of both victims and victors, commanders and soldiers, women and men. Photographs of war memorials in Vietnam, France, and the United States beautifully augment his testimonials.<br /><br />Eloquent and deeply moving, <i>The Mourner's Song</i> will speak to anyone interested in the literature of war and the relevance of the classics to our most pressing contemporary needs."

S'The ancient period of Greek history, to which this volume is devoted, began in late Bronze Age in the second millennium and lasted almost to the end of the first century BCE, when the last remnant of the Hellenistic empire created by Alexander the Great was conquered by the Romans. Extant texts of law of actual laws are few and often found embedded in other sources, such as the works of orators and historians. Greek literature, from the epics of Homer to the classical dramas, provides a valuable source of information. However, since literary sources are fictional portrayals and often reflect the times and biases of the authors, other more concrete evidence from archaeology has been used throughout the volume to confirm and contextualize the literary evidence about women, crime, and punishment in ancient Greece. The volume is divided into three parts: (I) Mykenean and Archaic Greece, (II) Classical Greece, and (III the Hellenistic Period. The book includes illustrations, maps, lists of Hellenistic dynasties, and Indices of Persons, Place and Subjects.<br /><br />Crime and punishment, criminal law and its administration, are areas of ancient history that have been explored less than many other aspects of ancient civilizations. Throughout history women have been affected by crime both as victims and as offenders. In the ancient world, customary laws were created by men, formal laws were written by men, and both were interpreted and enforced by men. This two-volume work explores the role of gender in the formation and administration of ancient law and examines the many gender categories and relationships established in ancient law, including legal personhood, access to courts, citizenship, political office, religious office, professions, marriage, inheritance, and property ownership. Thus it focuses on women and crime within the context of women in the society.'

But with this privilege comes the grave responsibility to respect life, to treat animals with simple dignity and compassion.<br /><br />Somewhere along the way, something has gone wrong.<br /><br />In <i>Dominion</i>, we witness the annual convention of Safari Club International, an organization whose wealthier members will pay up to $20,000 to hunt an elephant, a lion or another animal, either abroad or in American "safari ranches," where the animals are fenced in pens. We attend the annual International Whaling Commission conference, where the skewed politics of the whaling industry come to light, and the focus is on developing more lethal, but not more merciful, methods of harvesting "living marine resources." And we visit a gargantuan American "factory farm," where animals are treated as mere product and raised in conditions of mass confinement, bred for passivity and bulk, inseminated and fed with machines, kept in tightly confined stalls for the entirety of their lives, and slaughtered in a way that maximizes profits and minimizes decency.<br /><br />Throughout <i>Dominion</i>, Scully counters the hypocritical arguments that attempt to excuse animal abuse: from those who argue that the Bible\'s message permits mankind to use animals as it pleases, to the hunter\'s argument that through hunting animal populations are controlled, to the popular and "scientifically proven" notions that animals cannot feel pain, experience no emotions, and are not conscious of their own lives.<br /><br />The result is eye opening, painful and infuriating, insightful and rewarding. <i>Dominion</i> is a plea for human benevolence and mercy, a scathing attack on those who would dismiss animal activists as mere sentimentalists, and a demand for reform from the government down to the individual. Matthew Scully has created a groundbreaking work, a book of lasting power and importance for all of us.<br /></div>'

Rising as if by magic from an empty prairie, Cheyenne was known the "Magic City" of the Plains. The cast of this great Western saga was colorful and imposing. Cattle barons and merchant kings. Cowboys and soldiers. Vigilantes and lawmen. Gamblers and gunfighters. The railroad brought to Cheyenne a parade of celebrities, from President Grant to Teddy Roosevelt, Wild Bill Hickok to Calamity Jane, Sarah Bernhardt to Buffalo Bill Cody. And Cheyenne was built and nurtured by such powerhouse urban pioneers as F.E. Warren and Joseph W. Carey. The Magic City was a classic product of the urban frontier. The Magic City soon became the "Holy City of the Cow," a wealthy center of the cattle frontier. Fortunes were made and lost, along with dreams that were realized and destroyed. Cheyenne was the scene of two of the West\'s landmark legal dramas, involving the Johnson County Wars and the notorious assassin, Tom Horn. Cheyenne also became known for one of America\'s premier rodeos, "The Daddy of \'em All," the Cheyenne Frontier Days Rodeo'

S"In retrospect, it seems as if the American Revolution was inevitable. But was it? In Founding Brothers, Joseph J. Ellis reveals that many of those truths we hold to be self-evident were actually fiercely contested in the early days of the republic.<br /><br />Ellis focuses on six crucial moments in the life of the new nation, including a secret dinner at which the seat of the nation's capital was determined--in exchange for support of Hamilton's financial plan; Washington's precedent-setting Farewell Address; and the Hamilton and Burr duel. Most interesting, perhaps, is the debate (still dividing scholars today) over the meaning of the Revolution. In a fascinating chapter on the renewed friendship between John Adams and Thomas Jefferson at the end of their lives, Ellis points out the fundamental differences between the Republicans, who saw the Revolution as a liberating act and hold the Declaration of Independence most sacred, and the Federalists, who saw the revolution as a step in the building of American nationhood and hold the Constitution most dear. Throughout the text, Ellis explains the personal, face-to-face nature of early American politics--and notes that the members of the revolutionary generation were conscious of the fact that they were establishing precedents on which future generations would rely."

And fifteen years ago, they also contained Bill Laurance, a budding ecologist seduced by the nature of the landscape in north Queensland. Laurance isn't your typical scientist: he wears cut-offs instead of white coats, enjoys the occasional food fight, and isn't afraid to speak his mind, even if it gets him into trouble, as it often did in the Australian rainforest and as he recounts in his marvelous Queensland journal <i>Stinging Trees and Wait-a-Whiles</i>.<br />The book is his record of the time he spent in this remote area and his run-ins with plant, animal, and human species alike. Laurance lived in a tiny town of loggers and farmers, and he witnessed firsthand the impact of conservation issues on individual lives. He found himself at the center of a bitter battle over conservation strategies and became not only the subject of small-town gossip but also the object of many residents' hatred. Keeping ahead of his high-spirited young volunteers, hounded by the drug-sniffing local policeman, and all the while trying to further his own research amid natural and unnatural obstacles, Laurance offers us a personal and hilarious account of fieldwork and life in the Australian outpost of Millaa Millaa. <i>Stinging Trees and Wait-a-Whiles</i> is a biology lesson, a conservation primer, and an utterly energetic story about an impressionable young man who wound up at the epicenter of an issue that tore a small town apart.<br />"

David Maister, whose international consulting practice has gained him the reputation among his peers as "the guru\'s guru, " brings together for the first time his most brilliant and penetrating work on virtually every management issue facing professional firms today. <br />Professional firms, he shows, are different from other business enterprises in two ways. First, they are in the business of providing highly customized services, and hence cannot apply many of the management principles developed for the mass production industrial world. Second, professional services are highly personalized and involve the skills of individuals. Firms must compete not only for clients, but also for talented professionals. Drawing on ten years\' research amid consulting to these unique and creative institutions, Maister explores issues ranging from marketing and business development to multinational strategies, from human resource policies to profit improvement strategies, from strategic planning to the effective behavior of practice leaders. His concepts and practical advice have already become gospel to accountants, consultants, lawyers, public relations agencies, executive search, and many other professions. <br />Maister simplifies management issues by observing that "every professional service firm in the world, regardless of size, specific profession, or country of operation, has the same mission statement: outstanding service to clients, satisfying careers for its people, and financial success for its owners." Professional service firms, he shows, must practice "balance sheet" management by learning to developtheir two key assets: client relationships and their stock of skill, talent, knowledge, and ability. <br />"David Maister\'s name is synonymous with the latest thinking in professional service firm management. This book suggests why." <br />--James L. Heskett, Professor, Harvard Business School <br />Co-author of "Service Breakthroughs"'

The trilogy is more than a journey into the past. Undset's own life, her familiarity with sagas, folklore &amp; a wide range of medieval literature, her experiences as a daughter, wife &amp; mother, &amp; her deep religious faith profoundly influenced her writing. Her grasp of the connections between past &amp; present &amp; of human nature itself, combined with the extraordinary quality of her writing, sets her works far above the historical novel genre. This new translation by Tina Nunnally, the 1st English version since Charles Archer's translation in the 1920s, captures her strengths as a stylist. Nunnally, an award-winning translator, retains the natural dialog &amp; lyrical flow of the original Norwegian, with its echoes of Old Norse legends, while deftly avoiding the stilted language &amp; false archaisms of Archer's translation. In addition, she restores key passages left out of that edition.<br /> Undset's ability to present a meticulously accurate historical portrait without sacrificing the poetry &amp; narrative drive of masterful storytelling was particularly significant in her homeland. Granted independence in 1905 after 500 years of foreign domination, Norway was eager to reclaim its national history &amp; culture. <i>Kristin Lavransdatter</i> became a touchstone for Undset's contemporaries, &amp; continues to be widely read by Norwegians today. In the more than 75 years since it was 1st published, it's also become a favorite throughout the world."

S'Set in seventeenth-century Denmark, Rose Tremain\'s dazzling, prize-winning tale is a pungently atmospheric, richly provocative, and masterfully orchestrated romance of point and counterpoint: loyalty and deception...tenderness and violence...community and alienation...peace and conflict..."Music &amp; Silence." Peter Claire is an English lutenist summoned to Denmark to join King Christian IV\'s royal orchestra. Designated the king\'s "Angel" because of the purity of his physical beauty, Peter falls helplessly in love with the lovely companion of Queen Kirsten, the king\'s adulterous wife. The young musician finds himself dangerously torn between loyalties, ensnared in the deep-seated unrest of a royal court where the forces of good and evil, of harmony and dissonance, are ensconced in a battle to the death.'

S'The "deconstruction" that is commonly seen to be the method of Derrida\'s philosophy has an inescapably negative connotation. To counter this view of Derrida\'s thought as basically destructive, David Farrell Krell invites readers to understand how it may instead be seen as fundamentally affirmative--just as Nietzsche\'s philosophy, so allegedly nihilistic, is at heart a call for tragic affirmation, in <em>amor fati</em>.<br /><br />But, while affirmative, Derrida is also engaged in a thinking of mourning, which he views as the promise of memory--a fragile yet vital promise that binds past and future. The book explores what mourning means in Derrida\'s writing and how the labors of mourning and affirmation are mediated by works of art. Thus the book engages many different areas of Derrida\'s work, from the classic texts of deconstruction to the more recent meditations on art and mourning.<br /><br />"This chance [affirmation without issue] can come to us only from you, do you hear me? Do you understand me? . . . And me, the purest of bastards, leaving bastards of all kinds just about everywhere." This passage from Derrida\'s <em>La Carte postale </em>nicely encapsulates what David Farrell Krell wants to convey about Derrida\'s thought<em>--</em>its astonishing mix of negativity and affirmation in his labors of mourning.'

After giving a succinct analysis of each in his introduction, Woodruff translates the lyrics into English that is both poetic and comprehensible. . . . Woodruff's rendering of the dialogue moves along easily; these are lines that any contemporary Antigone, Creon or Haemon might speak. Antigone's words on the gods' unwritten laws keep close to the Greek and yet would be authentic for a modern speaker. . . . Woodruff's introduction is a strong, clear, and clever blend of basic traditional information (to those who know Greek tragedy) and fresh insights. . . .

S"David Malouf is one of Australia's most popular novelists, and also one of its most elusive. Drawing on the whole range of his work - fiction, poetry, essays, his play and his libretti - Ivor Indyk presents Malouf as both a primitive and a romantic, a writer who draws deeply on the rhythms of nature in his expression of desires which go largely unrecognised in the social domain. Indyk's study explores the hidden logic of Malouf's art, revealing an underlying technique that works through emblem and analogy, releasing energies inhibited by more direct forms of expression. This emblematic technique allows Malouf to probe the dark side of desire, its relationship to violence, savagery and even death, while, on the other hand, it underwrites his moments of poetic illumination as he strives towards a visionary apprehension of unity and belonging."

Kristin Lavransdatter became a best seller, earning a position in the Book of the Month Club-a remarkable feat for a work that centers on a small country in the Middle Ages. There is no biography in English on Sigrid Undset, which makes this annotated bibliography so important. In one chapter, Maman has created a guide to the autobiographical information in Undset's own works. Much of the literature which is included in the bibliography has never before been put together in this kind of format. American reviews of the author's books, grouped by style of novel, internet resources, dissertations, as well as recent studies in Norwegian, comprise this comprehensive look at one of Norway's most important authors.

He begins with a definition that distinguishes between war and mere feuding: war involves group rather than individual issues, political or economic goals, and direction by some governmental structure, carried out with the intention of lasting results. With this definition, he finds that ants are the only other creatures that conduct it - battling other colonies for territory and slaves. But ants, unlike humans, are driven by their genes; in humans, changes in our culture and subsistence patterns, not our genetic hardware, brought the rise of organized warfare. O'Connell draws on anthropology and archeology to locate the rise of war sometime after the human transition from nomadic hunting and gathering to agriculture, when society split between farmers and pastoralists."

S'Before he began the U.S.A. trilogy, John Dos Passos prefigured his groundbreaking epic through three novels that provide a fascinating glimpse into his stunning achievement as an avant-garde prose stylist while they incisively chronicle early twentieth century Europe and America. "Manhattan Transfer" (1925), a kaleidoscopic portrait of New York City, is universally acknowledged as a modernist masterpiece. This lyrical, exuberantly experimental novel orchestrates the rising and falling fortunes of more than a dozen characters: Wall Street speculators, theatrical celebrities, impoverished immigrants, bootleggers, and anarchist rebels move through a maze of tenements and skyscrapers. The impressionistic "One Man\'s Initiation: 1917" (1920) draws upon Dos Passos\' experiences driving ambulances in France to portray the fear, uncertainty, and camaraderie of war. This Library of America edition includes passages censored by the book\'s original publisher. "Three Soldiers" (1921), here with the author\'s own introduction, delves deeply into the spiritual toll of war, dramatizing American servicemen fighting in battle, struggling against dehumanizing military regimentation, and experiencing the chaotic pleasures of Paris. <br /> Along with its companion volumes "Travel Books and Other Writings" (see opposite page) and U.S.A.

On this particular night a stranger steps out of the shadowy park to sit at the sidewalk tables and speak of love and murder.<br /><br />In "A Madness of Starlings," a father, teaching his children about protection from the predators of life, takes in a fledgling bird. But when it\'s time for the bird to fly away, the forces of nature come undone and a secret wisdom and terror enter the mind of the one who understands the language of birds.<br /><br />Finally, in "The Dark Game," a war hero and his men are captured and taken into a prison camp. There, tortures and torments await them, but the man named Gordon Raglan begins to use a childhood game of escape to help him discover a way to hunt the wolves surrounding him.'

And while this message may not seem stunningly original or fresh, Tolle\'s clear writing, supportive voice and enthusiasm make this an excellent manual for anyone who\'s ever wondered what exactly "living in the now" means. Foremost, Tolle is a world-class teacher, able to explain complicated concepts in concrete language. More importantly, within a chapter of reading this book, readers are already holding the world in a different container--more conscious of how thoughts and emotions get in the way of their ability to live in genuine peace and happiness.<p>Tolle packs a lot of information and inspirational ideas into <i>The Power of Now</i>. (Topics include the source of Chi, enlightened relationships, creative use of the mind, impermanence and the cycle of life.) Thankfully, he\'s added markers that symbolise "break time". This is when readers should close the book and mull over what they just read. As a result, <i>The Power of Now</i> reads like the highly acclaimed <i>A Course in Miracles</i>--a spiritual guidebook that has the potential to inspire just as many study groups and change just as many lives for the better. --<i>Gail Hudson</i></p>'

The malls are jam-packed with staggering shoppers. There\'s not a twinkle light anywhere to be seen in her apartment. <br /><br />And there\'s a strange man in her kitchen.<br /><br />Sure, this has happened to Stephanie Plum before. Strangers, weirdos, felons, creeps, and lunatics are always finding their way to her front door. But this guy is different. This guy is mysterious, sexy--and he has his own agenda. His name is Diesel and he is a man on a mission. And Diesel is unlike anyone Stephanie has ever met before in her life. The question is, what does he want with her? Can he help her find a little old toy maker who has skipped out on his bail right before Christmas? Can he survive the Plum family holiday dinner? Can he get Stephanie a tree that doesn\'t look like it was grown next to a nuclear power plant? These questions and more are keeping Stephanie awake at night. Not to mention the fact that she needs to find a bunch of nasty elves, her sister Valerie has a Christmas "surprise" for the Plums, her niece Mary Alice doesn\'t believe in Santa anymore, and Grandma Mazur has a new stud muffin. So bring out the plastic reindeer, strap on your jingle bells, and get ready to celebrate the holidays-Jersey style. <i>Visions of Sugar Plums</i>-the world of Plum has never been merrier!<br />'

S'For more than three decades, bestselling novelist John Saul has been summoning macabre masterpieces from the darkest realms of his imagination. With each new book, his instinct for playing upon our deepest dread has grown only stronger and more sinister. He?s never been afraid to push the boundaries of suspense and confront us with what frightens us most.<br /><br />After his father?s untimely death sends fifteen-year-old Ryan McIntyre into an emotional tailspin, his mother enrolls him in St. Isaac?s Catholic boarding school, hoping the venerable institution with a reputation for transforming wayward teens can work its magic on her son. But troubles are not unknown even at St. Isaac, where Ryan arrives to find the school awash in news of one student?s violent death, another?s mysterious disappearance, and growing incidents of disturbing behavior within the hallowed halls.<br /><br />Things begin to change when Father Sebastian joins the faculty. Armed with unprecedented knowledge and uncanny skills acquired through years of secret study, the young priest has been dispatched on an extraordinary and controversial mission: to prove the power of one of the Church?s most arcane sacred rituals, exorcism. Willing or not, St. Isaac?s most troubled students will be pawns in Father Sebastian?s one-man war against evil?a war so surprisingly effective that the pope himself takes notice of the seemingly miraculous events unfolding an ocean away.<br /><br />But Ryan, drawn ever more deeply into Father Sebastian?s ministrations, sees?and knows?otherwise. As he witnesses with mounting dread the transformations of his fellow pupils, his certainty grows that forces of darkness, not divinity, are at work. Evil is not being cast out . . . something else is being called forth. Something that hasn?t stirred since the Inquisition?s reign of terror. Something nurtured through the ages to do its vengeful masters? unholy bidding. Something whose hour has finally come to bring hell unto earth.'

S"The idea of human cruelty to animals so consumes novelist Elizabeth Costello in her later years that she can no longer look another person in the eye: humans, especially meat-eating ones, seem to her to be conspirators in a crime of stupefying magnitude taking place on farms and in slaughterhouses, factories, and laboratories across the world.<br /><br />Costello's son, a physics professor, admires her literary achievements, but dreads his mother's lecturing on animal rights at the college where he teaches. His colleagues resist her argument that human reason is overrated and that the inability to reason does not diminish the value of life; his wife denounces his mother's vegetarianism as a form of moral superiority.<br /><br />At the dinner that follows her first lecture, the guests confront Costello with a range of sympathetic and skeptical reactions to issues of animal rights, touching on broad philosophical, anthropological, and religious perspectives. Painfully for her son, Elizabeth Costello seems offensive and flaky, but--dare he admit it?--strangely on target.<br /><br />Here the internationally renowned writer J. M. Coetzee uses fiction to present a powerfully moving discussion of animal rights in all their complexity. He draws us into Elizabeth Costello's own sense of mortality, her compassion for animals, and her alienation from humans, even from her own family. In his fable, presented as a Tanner Lecture sponsored by the University Center for Human Values at Princeton University, Coetzee immerses us in a drama reflecting the real-life situation at hand: a writer delivering a lecture on an emotionally charged issue at a prestigious university. Literature, philosophy, performance, and deep human conviction--Coetzee brings all these elements into play.<br /><br />As in the story of Elizabeth Costello, the Tanner Lecture is followed by responses treating the reader to a variety of perspectives, delivered by leading thinkers in different fields. Coetzee's text is accompanied by an introduction by political philosopher Amy Gutmann and responsive essays by religion scholar Wendy Doniger, primatologist Barbara Smuts, literary theorist Marjorie Garber, and moral philosopher Peter Singer, author of <i>Animal Liberation.</i> Together the lecture-fable and the essays explore the palpable social consequences of uncompromising moral conflict and confrontation."

Drawing on some of her most frightening moments as an undercover agent, as well as her unique channels of information, the Countess crafts a novel of stunning suspense. When a handsome young man calls on business one day for Aline a pleasant and casual acquaintanceship begins. Yet the flowers she receives suggest he has something different in mind. Only afterward, when it is too late to change the course of events, will she learn the truth - that her charming new friend is actually the notorious terrorist known as Carlos the Jackal. A deadly game of cat-and-mouse ensues, taking Aline through a host of lavish settings in Bavaria, Paris, and Marbella, where friends can no longer be trusted and she will need all her skills as a former OSS operative to get out alive."

To American readers Unger\'s biography will provide a stark reminder of just how near run a thing was our War of Independence and the degree to which our forefathers\' victory hinged on the help of our French allies, marshalled for George Washington by his \'adopted\' son, Lafayette. But even more absorbing and much less well known to the general reader will be Unger\'s account of Lafayette\'s idealistic but naive efforts to plant the fruits of the American democracy he so admired in the unreceptive soil of his homeland. His inspired oratory produced not the constitutional democracy he sought but the bloody Jacobin excesses of the French Revolution."-Larry Collins, coauthor, Is Paris Burning? and O Jerusalem!<br /><br />"A lively and entertaining portrait of one of the most important supporting actors in the two revolutions that transformed the modern world."-Susan Dunn, author, Sister Revolutions: French Lightning, American Light<br /><br />"Harlow Unger has cornered the market on muses to emerge as America\'s most readable historian.

S'The period between 1867 and 1914 remains the greatest watershed in human history since the emergence of settled agricultural societies: the time when an expansive civilization based on synergy of fuels, science, and technical innovation was born. At its beginnings in the 1870s were dynamite, the telephone, photographic film, and the first light bulbs. Its peak decade - the astonishing 1880s - brought electricity - generating plants, electric motors, steam turbines, the gramophone, cars, aluminum production, air-filled rubber tires, and prestressed concrete. And its post-1900 period saw the first airplanes, tractors, radio signals and plastics, neon lights and assembly line production. This book is a systematic interdisciplinary account of the history of this outpouring of European and American intellect and of its truly epochal consequences. It takes a close look at four fundamental classes of these epoch-making innovations: formation, diffusion, and standardization of electric systems; invention and rapid adoption of internal combustion engines; the unprecedented pace of new chemical syntheses and material substitutions; and the birth of a new information age. These chapters are followed by an evaluation of the lasting impact these advances had on the 20th century, that is, the creation of high-energy societies engaged in mass production aimed at improving standards of living.<br />'

In Dahl\'s book, the gremlins\' motivation for sabotaging British aircraft is revenge of the destruction of their forest home, which was razed to make way for an aircraft factory. The principal character in the book, Gus, has his Hawker Hurricane fighter destroyed over the English Channel by a gremlin, but is able to convince the gremlins as they parachute into the water that they should join forces against a common enemy, Hitler and the Nazis, rather than fight each other.

Set at the time of the Norman Conquest, Ivanhoe returns from the Crusades to claim his inheritance and the love of Rowena and becomes involved in the struggle between Richard Coeur de Lion and his Norman brother John. The gripping narrative is structured by a series of conflicts: Saxon versus Norman, Christian versus Jew, men versus women, played out against Scott's unflinching moral realism."

S'This first book from Chicago author Chris Ware is a pleasantly-decorated view at a lonely and emotionally-impaired "everyman" (Jimmy Corrigan, the Smartest Kid on Earth), who is provided, at age 36, the opportunity to meet his father for the first time. An improvisatory romance which gingerly deports itself between 1890\'s Chicago and 1980\'s small town Michigan, the reader is helped along by thousands of colored illustrations and diagrams, which, when read rapidly in sequence, provide a convincing illusion of life and movement. The bulk of the work is supported by fold-out instructions, an index, paper cut-outs, and a brief apology, all of which concrete to form a rich portrait of a man stunted by a paralyzing fear of being disliked.'

In the spare and powerful prose for which Coetzee is renowned, <i>The Nobel Lecture in Literature, 2003</i> is a provocative testament to the uncompromising vision of one of the world?s most profound writers.'

Built in the 1950s and 1960s, these whimsical vacation homes reflected the idea of summer leisure for a generation more concerned with fun on the beach than ostentatious display. For clients in the Hamptons, the Jersey shore, and in New England, Geller built dozens of houses, most of wood and most on modest budgets. Geller, who worked with Raymond Loewy and directed the design of such modernist landmarks as the Lever House in New York, combined a modern interest in light, breeze, and functional living with playful form-making. These spirited houses, many shown here for the first time through vintage photographs and drawings, still delight today and will inspire anyone interested in beach house living.'

Even as he admires the FBI\'s vast resources, Alex grows impatient with the Bureau\'s clumsiness and caution when it is time to move.

Meet Dr \'Fingers\' Schafer, the Lobotomy Kid, and his greatest creation, \'The Complete American De-anxietized Man\', a marvel of invasive psychiatry who has been reduced to nothing but a spinal cord. Told by an Ivy League-educated narcotics addict, Naked Lunch juxtaposes two journeys: the narrator\'s physical progress from America to North Africa, via Mexico, and a terrifying descent into his own altered consciousness. In this "Interzone", loosely based on Burroughs\' temporary home Tangier, sex, drugs and murder are the most basic of commodities, and the basest desires have become completely banal.<br /><br />Provocative, influential, morbidly fascinating and mordantly funny, Naked Lunch takes us on an exhilarating ride through the darkest recesses of the human psyche - a ride which stunned the literary world when first published in the repressed 1950s, and is still guaranteed to epater more than a few bourgeois. Over forty years after first publication, Burroughs scholar Barry Miles and Burroughs\' longtime editor James Grauerholz have compiled this definitive restored text, correcting numerous errors that have accumulated over the years, and incorporating all of Burroughs\' notes and accompanying essays.

Following a world expert on birdsong from the woods of Martha\'s Vineyard to the tropical forests of Central America, Don Staop brings to life the quest to unravel this ancient mystery: Why do birds sing and what do their songs really mean?<br />In this creative mixture of reportage, storytelling, and research, Stap distills the complexities of the study of birdsong and unveils a remarkable discovery that sheds light on the mystery of mysteries: why young birds in the suborder oscines--the "true" songbirds--must learn their songs while closely related birds are born with their songs genetically encoded. As the story unfolds, Stap contemplates our enduring fascination with birdsong, from ancient pictographs and early Greek soothsayers to the story of Mozart\'s pet starling. He identifies birds by their specific sounds and calls, and explains the true function of a bird\'s song, from mating calls to claims of territory.<br />In a modern, noisy world, it is increasingly difficult to hear the sounds of nature around us. Exploring birdsong takes us to that rare place--in danger of disappearing forever--where one hears only the planet\'s oldest music.<br />'

Logan agrees, but on one condition--that she will volunteer to be the camp nurse so she can keep a close eye on Kim. Under starlit skies and breezy summer days, Logan struggles with her growing attraction to the handsome pediatrician--all the while, battling the urge to hold on too tightly to Kim. Will Logan ever be able to let go enough to allow love into both their lives?"

S'The story is set in Ayrshire and Lanarkshire around 1306, shortly after the death of William Wallace during the Wars of Scottish Independence. From Scott\'s introduction: "The incidents on which the ensuing Novel mainly turns, are derived from the ancient Metrical Chronicle of The Brace, by Archdeacon Barbour, and from the History of the Houses of Douglas and Angus, by David Hume of Godscroft; and are sustained by the immemorial tradition of the western parts of Scotland. They are so much in consonance with the spirit and manners of the troubled age to which they are referred, that I can see no reason for doubting their being founded in fact; the names, indeed, of numberless localities in the vicinity of Douglas Castle, appear to attest, beyond suspicion, many even of the smallest circumstances embraced in the story of Godscroft."'

That's what it's like to stand in the eye of a hurricane. <br /> In Divine Wind, Kerry Emanuel, one of the world's leading authorities on hurricanes, gives us an engaging account of these awe-inspiring meteorological events, revealing how hurricanes and typhoons have literally altered human history, thwarting military incursions and changing the course of explorations. Offering an account of the physics of the tropical atmosphere, the author explains how such benign climates give rise to the most powerful storms in the world and tells what modern science has learned about them. Interwoven with this scientific account are descriptions of some of the most important hurricanes in history and relevant works of art and literature. For instance, he describes the 17th-century hurricane that likely inspired Shakespeare's The Tempest and that led to the British colonization of Bermuda. We also read about the Galveston Hurricane of 1900, by far the worst natural calamity in U.S. history, with a death toll between 8,000 and 12,000 that exceeded the San Francisco earthquake, the Johnstown Flood, and the Okeechobee Hurricane co Boasting more than one hundred color illustrations, frommbined.

Arbel suggests that mythological patterns of expression, as well as themes and models rooted in Near Eastern mythological traditions are employed, in a spiritualized fashion, to communicate mystical content.

I used to not like God because God didn\'t resolve. But that was before any of this happened." In Donald Miller\'s early years, he was vaguely familiar with a distant God. But when he came to know Jesus Christ, he pursued the Christian life with great zeal. Within a few years he had a successful ministry that ultimately left him feeling empty, burned out, and, once again, far away from God. In this intimate, soul-searching account, Miller describes his remarkable journey back to a culturally relevant, infinitely loving God.'

(lp2131
S'Branding, says James Twitchell, is nothing more than commercial storytelling; brands are the stories that are associated with products. (For example, the special taste of Evian, says Twitchell, is in the brand, not the water.) Branding has become so successful, so ubiquitous that even institutions that we thought were above branding, "antithetical" to branding, have succumbed. Such cultural institutions as religion, higher education, and the art world have learned to love Madison Avenue or lose market share. Of course, most ministers, university presidents, and museum directors will insist that branding has nothing to do with them, but as Twitchell brilliantly demonstrates in this witty, insightful examination of three of our most important cultural institutions, wherever supply exceeds demand branding follows.The rise of the megachurch epitomizes branding in religion. From its inception the megachurch was designed not to compete with other churches but to bring in the "unchurched," especially men, worshippers who might otherwise be home watching television or strolling through the mall on a Sunday morning. The megachurches have been phenomenally popular, none more so than Willow Creek Community Church, just south of Chicago, one of the oldest megachurches, which Twitchell analyzes in "Branded Nation."<br /><br />Colleges and universities have embraced branding as they have grown more alike. Especially among the top schools in the country, the student bodies, the faculties, often even the campuses themselves are practically interchangeable. What distinguishes each school is the story it tells about itself. Now every institution of higher learning has its image organizers, its brandmanagers, usually in the admissions or development offices, whose job it is to make their institution seem different from all the rest.<br /><br />Even museums, with their multimillion-dollar Monets, have seen the advantages of branding. The blockbuster exhibitions often put familiar paintings in a new context, that is, they provide a new narrative, branding the art. Museums keep expanding their stores, placing them not just near the entrance on the ground floor but throughout the museum, in the galleries themselves. Some museums, such as the Guggenheim, even franchise themselves, turning the institution itself into a brand.<br /><br />In short, high culture is beginning to look more and more like the rest of our culture.<br /><br />In perhaps his most subversive observation, Twitchell doesn\'t condemn the branding of cultural institutions. On the contrary, he believes that branding may be invigorating our high culture, bringing it to new audiences, making it a more integral part of our lives.<br /><br />Not since "Bobos in Paradise" has there been such a trenchant, provocative analysis of our world.'

Like thousands of other Japanese Americans they have been reclassified, virtually overnight, as enemy aliens and are about to be uprooted from their home and sent to a dusty internment camp in the Utah desert. <br /><br />In this lean and devastatingly evocative first novel, Julie Otsuka tells their story from five flawlessly realized points of view and conveys the exact emotional texture of their experience: the thin-walled barracks and barbed-wire fences, the omnipresent fear and loneliness, the unheralded feats of heroism.

While conservation biologists are working to address environmental problems humans have created on land, loss of marine biodiversity, including extinctions and habitat degradation, has received much less attention. At the same time, marine sciences such as oceanography and fisheries biology have largely ignored issues of conservation. Marine Conservation Biology brings together for the first time in a single volume leading experts from around the world to apply the lessons and thinking of conservation biology to marine issues. Contributors including James M. Acheson, Louis W. Botsford, James T. Carlton, Kristina Gjerde, Selina S. Heppell, Ransom A. Myers, Julia K. Parrish, Stephen R.

Continuing with the second half of the introduction to his shamelessly meandering graphic novel <i>Rusty Brown </i>(which began last issue at a private school in the 1970s Midwest), the six-sided crystal suggested by the exegesis of the first installment is slowly turned and examined in midmorning winter sunlight sometime between the bell of first period and the conclusion of lunch for the first through the fourth grades. Also included are more thorough examinations of many of the main characters\' cloudy motivations, personal habits, and favorite restaurants, to say nothing of the small dust mote around which they have coalesced and the complications in its life due to the acquisition of superpowers sometime the night before. Like the irritating distant family member you only have to see once a year, the <i>ACME Novelty Library </i>#17 will, as was its predecessor, be published by the author in a single, limited edition only, never to be reprinted until the entire library is collected as a single volume, though it may be promptly remaindered and/or discarded.<br /></div>'

It is also where Corrigan was serialized to great acclaim and success before going supernova when collected by Pantheon in 2000, selling over 70,000 copies in four hardcover printings. </p><p> "Rusty Brown" will be serialized in <i>ACME</i> over the course of several issues (and Pantheon will similarly collect the story in hardcover sometime upon completion, several years from now). The first installment begins with young Rusty, an outcast in his suburban Chicago elementary school, befriended solely by his Supergirl action figure until he meets new kid on the block and fellow comic nerd, Chalky White. Rusty\'s story is an uncomfortably vivid and uncompromising look into the life of a social outcast. Ultimately, <i>Rusty Brown</i> will run longer than <i>Jimmy Corrigan</i>, tracing Brown\'s life through adulthood, along with every excruciating moment of failure it brings. </p><p><i>The ACME Novelty Library</i> series has been the most acclaimed comic book series of the last ten years, as well as one of the bestselling contemporary comics on the racks. This is only the second issue, however, that has been available to the general book trade, enabling booksellers to satisfy demand for Ware\'s work post-<i>Jimmy Corrigan</i> while Ware builds toward the next collection. The format also allows Ware to indulge us with many surprises as well, from Ware\'s faux-advertising sections and elaborate three-dimensional cut-out designs. </p><p>Author Biography: <i>Chris Ware</i> published his first comic strip in <i>The Daily Texan</i>, the student newspaper serving The University of Texas at Austin.

To combat this trend, Dr. Seligman began the Penn Depression Prevention Project, the first long term study aimed at 8 to 12 year olds. His findings were revolutionary, proving that children can be against depression by being taught how to challenge their pessimistic thoughts. "The Optimistic Child" offers parents and teachers the tools developed in this study to teach children of all ages life skills that transform helplessness into mastery and bolster self-esteem. Learning the skills of optimism not only reduces the risk of depression but boosts school performance, improves physical health, and provides children with the self-reliance they need as they approach the teenage years and beyond. world of optimists is a bigger world, a world of more possibilities, says Seligman. Filled with practical advice and written in clear, helpful language, this book is an invaluable resource for caregivers who want to open up this world for their children."The first major work to provide an effective program for preventing depression in childhood--and probably later in life."--Aaron T.

Join Captain Ahab, an eerily compelling madman, as he pursues an unholy war against a creature as vast and dangerous and unknowable as the sea itself. In his monomaniacal quest, Ahab focuses his distilled hatred and suffering--and that of generations before him--against one single creature, and pursues it relentlessly.<br /><br />More than just a novel of adventure, more than an encyclopedia of whaling lore and legend, this is a haunting, mesmerizing, and important social commentary populated with several of the most unforgettable and enduring characters in literature. Written with wonderfully redemptive humor, <i>Moby-Dick</i> is a profound and timeless inquiry into character, faith, and the nature of perception.'

In his highly-acclaimed book of the same title, he shares the deeply personal meditation that led him to discover the place within which God has chosen to dwell. This Lent course, which has been adapted from the book, helps us to reflect on the meaning of the parable for our own lives. Divided into five sessions, the course moves through the parable exploring our reaction to the story: the younger son's leaving and return, the father's restoration of sonship, the elder son's resentment and the father's compassion. All of us who have experienced loneliness, dejection, jealousy or anger will respond to the persistent themes of homecoming, affirmation and reconciliation."

Each volume is edited by the San Francisco Cartoon Art Museum\'s Bill Blackbeard, the world\'s foremost authority on early 20th Century American comic strips, and designed by <em>Jimmy Corrigan</em> author Chris Ware. In addition to the 104 full-page black-and-white Sunday strips from 1927 and 1928 (Herriman did not use color until 1935), the book includes introductions by Blackbeard, vaudeville historian Ben Schwartz and reproductions of rare Herriman ephemera from Ware\'s own extensive collection, as well as annotations and other notes by Ware and Blackbeard. <em>Krazy Kat</em> is a love story, focusing on the relationships of its three main characters. Krazy Kat adored Ignatz Mouse. Ignatz Mouse just tolerated Krazy Kat, except for recurrent onsets of targeting tumescence, which found expression in the fast delivery of bricks to Krazy\'s cranium. Offisa Pup loved Krazy and sought to protect "her" (Herriman always maintained that Krazy was genderless) by throwing Ignatz in jail. Each of the characters was ignorant of the others\' true motivations, and this simple structure allowed Herriman to build entire worlds of meaning into the actions, building thematic depth and sweeping his readers up by the looping verbal rhythms of Krazy &amp; Co.\'s unique dialogue.'

Temple Grandin draws upon a long, distinguished career as an animal scientist and her own experiences with autism to deliver an extraordinary message about how animals act, think, and feel. She has a perspective like that of no other expert in the field, which allows her to offer unparalleled observations and groundbreaking ideas.

Ten years later, the sentence was carried out, despite the extraordinary efforts of Kitty Behan, a brilliant and dedicated young lawyer who devoted two years of her life to gathering evidence of Coleman\'s innocence, evidence so compelling that media around the world came to question the verdict.

(lp2467
S'Patricia Cornwell\'s legendary crime fiction creation, Virginia\'s Chief Medical Examiner Kay Scarpetta, has logged a host of fans among mystery readers and, within the bounds of her fictional world, an equally impressive tally of individuals intent on causing her grievous physical or psychological harm.<br /><br />The 11th Scarpetta novel, <i>The Last Precinct</i>, doesn\'t add any new names to the second roster. Instead, in a sweeping narrative gesture toward retrospection (less-than-fervent fans might whisper "or stagnation"), the novel depends largely on ground already covered in its predecessors, <i>Black Notice</i> and, to a lesser extent, <i>Point of Origin</i>. All the familiar faces--friend and foe--are here: police captain Marino, Kay\'s niece Lucy, the so-called Werewolf murderer, and (in memoriam) Kay\'s lover Benton Wesley and his killer, Carrie Grethen. Kay, who nearly killed the Werewolf in self-defense as <i>Black Notice</i> came to a close, now finds herself the target of a corrupt police investigation that will dredge her darkest secrets from the deepest corners of her past.<br /><br />Torn between a desire to clear her name and the instinct of a wounded animal to turn against even its would-be rescuers, Kay sifts through the forensic evidence that seems to link Chandonne to other horrific events in her past, up to and including Wesley\'s murder. Physical analysis, however, will not be enough to right her up-ended world. Instead, Kay must rely on the strategic support of her niece, cofounder of the Last Precinct (an odd, ill-defined organization that is, in the words of its motto, "where you go when there is nowhere left"), and on her willingness to examine her own fears, misconceptions, and anything-but-altruistic motives. The most important setting in this novel is not the morgue--it\'s the living room where Kay\'s therapist forces her to address (you guessed it) "unresolved issues."<br /><br />The novel\'s focus on Kay\'s emotional evolution does not, unfortunately, mask the leaps of illogic that pepper the plot\'s murky stew. More disturbing than these occasional lapses, however, is the feeling that Cornwell has written herself into a corner. The Scarpetta of <i>The Last Precinct</i> is a far cry from the irritably independent woman of previous books. Her often over-inflated musings are more tiresome than tantalizing. Cornwell\'s impressive track record makes this excursion a bit disappointing, but that same record means that loyal fans will race to acquire the book anyway and that the odds of her returning to her usual stellar form next time are (hurrah!) favorable. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i>'

In doing so, we do them and ourselves a grave disservice. We are indeed facing an unprecedented crisis of leadership, Ronald Heifetz avows, but it stems as much from our demands and expectations as from any leader's inability to meet them. His book gets at both of these problems, offering a practical approach to leadership for those who lead as well as those who look to them for answers. Fitting the theory and practice of leadership to our extraordinary times, the book promotes a new social contract, a revitalization of our civic life just when we most desperately need it. Drawing on a dozen years of research among managers, officers, and politicians in the public realm and the private sector, among the nonprofits, and in teaching, Heifetz presents clear, concrete prescriptions for anyone who needs to take the lead in almost any situation, under almost any organizational conditions, no matter who's in charge. His strategy of leadership applies not only to people at the top but also to those who must lead without authority - activists as well as presidents, managers as well as workers on the frontline. Here are Lyndon Johnson, Martin Luther King Jr., and Mahatma Gandhi, in triumph and in tragedy. Here too are military officers and soldiers, doctors and patients, college students, and local civic groups. Sketched with precision, touched by empathy, and unfailingly interesting, this cast of characters brings Heifetz's theory to life, demonstratingwhat a practitioner can do - or avoid doing - to assume leadership in an age without easy answers."

S"Psychological thriller set in Berlin during the Cold War, based on an actual (but little known) incident which tells of the secret tunnel under the Soviet sector which the British and Americans built in 1954 to gain access to the Russians' communication system. The protagonist, Leonard Marnham, is a 25-year-old, naive, unsophisticated English post office technician who is astonished and alarmed to find himself involved in a top-secret operation. At the same time that he loses his political innocence, Leonard experiences his sexual initiation in a clandestine affair with a German divorcee five years his senior. As his two secret worlds come together, events develop into a gruesome nightmare, building to a searing, unforgettable scene of surrealist intensity in which Leonard and his lover try to conceal evidence of a murder. Acting to save himself from a prison sentence, Leonard desperately performs an act of espionage whose ironic consequences resonate down the years to a twister of an ending. Though its plot rivals any thriller in narrative tension, this novel is also a character study--of a young man coming of age in bizarre circumstances, and of differences in national character: the gentlemanly Brits, all decorum and civility; the brash, impatient Americans; the cynical Germans. McEwan's neat, tensile prose raises this book to the highest level of the genre."

The information is presented in a month-by-month format starting with planning a pregnancy and choosing a practitioner, and follows through to six weeks after delivery. Each chapter begins with an explanation of what to expect at a particular month\'s prenatal visit and a brief description of how mom and baby are growing and changing before getting to the heart of the matter: What You May Be Concerned About. Topics are presented as questions ranging from "Should I be taking vitamins?" to "What if I forget everything I learn in childbirth education class?" to "Will I be able to breastfeed?" The answers are generally reassuring and provide enough information to soothe a worried mom between prenatal visits. Despite the reassuring answers, however, the sheer volume of worries discussed may alarm an otherwise calm mom-to-be. <p> The book also features a complete nutrition plan (though many women may find it difficult to follow), a special chapter just for expectant dads, and extensive information about dealing with minor illnesses, chronic conditions, and pregnancy complications. <i>What to Expect</i> has guided countless women through their pregnancies and makes an informative addition to the mainstream pregnancy and childbirth bookshelf. <i>--Jennifer Lindsay</i></p>'

(lp2667
S'Six months after the Declaration of Independence, the American Revolution was all but lost. A powerful British force had routed the Americans at New York, occupied three colonies, and advanced within sight of Philadelphia. George Washington lost ninety percent of his army and was driven across the Delaware River. Panic and despair spread through the states. Yet, as David Hackett Fischer recounts in this riveting history, Washington--and many other Americans--refused to let the Revolution die. Even as the British and Germans spread their troops across New Jersey, the people of the colony began to rise against them. George Washington saw his opportunity and seized it. On Christmas night, as a howling nor\'easter struck the Delaware Valley, he led his men across the river and attacked the exhausted Hessian garrison at Trenton, killing or capturing nearly a thousand men. A second battle of Trenton followed within days. The Americans held off a counterattack by Lord Cornwallis\'s best troops, then were almost trapped by the British force. Under cover of night, Washington\'s men stole behind the enemy and struck them again, defeating a brigade at Princeton. The British were badly shaken. In twelve weeks of winter fighting, their army suffered severe damage, their hold on New Jersey was broken, and their strategy was ruined. Fischer\'s richly textured narrative reveals the crucial role of contingency in these events. We see how the campaign unfolded in a sequence of difficult choices by many actors, from generals to civilians, on both sides. While British and German forces remained rigid and hierarchical, Americans evolved an open and flexible system that was fundamental to their success. At the same time, they developed an American ethic of warfare that John Adams called "the policy of humanity," and showed that moral victories could have powerful material effects. The startling success of Washington and his compatriots not only saved the faltering American Revolution, but helped to give it new meaning, in a pivotal moment for American history.'

S'This book is a pioneering study of the often forgotten Sephardi voices of the Holocaust. It is an account of the Sephardi Jewish community of the Greek city of Salonika, which at one point numbered 80,000 members, but which was almost completely annihilated during the German occupation of Greece in the Second World War. Through her systematic series of interviews with the remnants of this once-flourishing community, the author reawakens the communal memory and is able to show how individual identities and memories can be seen to have been shaped by historical experience. She traces the radical demographic and political changes Salonika itself has undergone, in particular the ethnic and religious composition of the city s population, and she interprets the narratives of the Salonikan Jewish survivors in the context of this changing landscape of memory and as part of contemporary Greece. With the vivid power of oral history and ethnography, this book highlights a significant aspect of the Jewish experience.'

S'In a way, Candace Bushnell\'s <i>Lipstick Jungle</i> picks up where her career-defining book <i>Sex and the City</i> left off, in the money-soaked, power-hungry, beauty-obsessed jungle that is New York City. This time around, the ladies are a bit older, a lot richer, but not particularly wiser nor more endearing than Bushnell\'s earlier heroines. <p> <i>Lipstick Jungle</i> weaves the stories of Nico O\'Neilly, Wendy Healy, and Victory Ford, numbers 8, 12, and 17 on <i>The New York Post</i>\'s list of "New York\'s 50 Most Powerful Women." <br /><br />But this is 21st Century New York, and to get ahead and stay ahead, these women will do anything, including jeopardizing their personal and professional relationships. Take for example Nico, editor-in-chief of <i>Bonfire</i> magazine, who betrays her boss to rise to the top of the entire magazine division at media mega-giant Splatch-Verner. As president of Paradour Pictures, Wendy may be poised to win an Oscar for her 10-year labor-of-love, <i>Ragged Pilgrims</i>, but her marriage is in shambles and her children care more about a $50,000 pony than their mother. And for single, 43-year-old fashion designer Victory, pleasing tough critics may be more important than ever finding the real relationship she\'s convinced herself she doesn\'t need.</p><p> This racy tale of women behaving badly manages to shrewdly flip the tables to show us how gender roles are essentially interchangeable, given the right circumstances. Whether that was Bushnell\'s intent when crafting this wicked tale is another story. <i>--Gisele Toueg</i> </p> <br /><br /><b>Q:</b> Were Victory, Wendy, and Nico inspired by any real-life women?<br /><b>A:</b> The characters and situations in <i>Lipstick Jungle</i> were inspired by the real-life women I know and admire in New York City. As with <i>Sex and the City</i>, I spent a lot of time thinking about where women were today, and what I noticed was that there was a fascinating group of women in their forties who were leading non-traditional lives. They were highly successful and motivated, they often had children, and usually were the providers for their families, and yet, they didn\'t fit the old stereotype of the witchy businesswoman. Indeed, so many of these women were the girls next door, the girls who reminded me of my best friends when I was a kid and we used to fantasize about the great things we were going to do in life. Like the women in <i>Sex and the City</i>, the <i>Lipstick Jungle</i> women are charting new lives for themselves, redefining what it means to be a woman when you really are as powerful, or more powerful, than a man.<br /><br /> Of course, you probably want specifics, so I will say that there was a moment when it all clicked. Tina Brown used to write a terrific column in the <i>Washington Post</i>, and one of the things she was always mentioning was how there was a group of powerful women who were meeting and lunching at Michael\'s restaurant. They\'d been working for over twenty years, their children were now in their early teens and didn\'t need them every minute, and now, in their forties or early fifties, they had time to strive for new career goals and to spend more time with their girlfriends. I thought, "Aha--that\'s the Lipstick Jungle." <br /><br /><b>Q:</b> What kind of research did you do to cover fashion, film, and publishing in one book?<br /><b>A:</b> To research fashion, film and publishing, I did what I always do--I talked to my girlfriends! Of course, it helps that I\'ve worked in magazine publishing and have had my share of experience with Hollywood. I\'m also lucky enough to have a couple of girlfriends who are top designers, who offered to help me out with the specific details. I still remember the afternoon when one of my girlfriends and I sat down to talk--she was over eight months pregnant, and I was worried that we were going to have to run to the hospital!'

The book is divided into two comprehensive parts. Part I outlines the disturbing facts about America\'s possession-crazed youth and the society that has distorted their views. You\'ll be introduced to everything from the "three-headed monster"--a high-powered triumvirate of consumer products companies, media conglomerates, and advertising agencies that has tremendous influence over your children--to the distorted view of the American Dream as shaped by principles known as "The <i>Teen</i> Commandments." In learning what you\'re up against you can teach financial responsibility from a position of strength.<br /><br />In Part II, Dungan offers creative and convincing examples on how to leverage his highly successful "Share-Save-Spend" approach to money - critical elements for you to help your children break free from the materialism that has become ingrained in our society. Through insightful anecdotes and simple exercises, you will learn how to:<br /><br /><br />Talk to your children about money Understand the difference between financial wants and needs Increase the probability of your children having a prosperous life Raise your children\'s marketing IQ Maintain healthy financial boundaries Set a healthy example for your children to follow The "Share-Save-Spend" methodology will help your children establish healthy financial habits and will undoubtedly become their foundation for making a lifetime of responsible financial decisions.<br /><br /><b>Nathan Dungan</b> is an innovative leader in the financial services industry.

The Pygmalion of legend falls in love with his perfect female statue and persuades Venus to bring her to life so that he can marry her.

One of the most controversial and, ultimately, canonized photographers of our time, Mapplethorpe died in March 1989, at the peak of his critical acclaim. This collection was among the last projects that he undertook and includes a retrospective of his portraits of women, the majority of which have never been published in book form. "Some Women" explores female beauty in many incarnations, beauty both idealized and externalized. It brings together eighty-six of Mapplethorpe\'s finest images - a balance of his luminous nudes, fashion shots, and portraits. The women included come from every age group and rnge from the unfamiliar to the notable. Isabella Rossellini, Grace Jones, Sigourney Weaver, Yoko Ono, Brooke Shields, Cyndi Lauper, Melanie Griffith, Susan Sarandon, and Mapplethorpe\'s close friend Patti Smith are among the numerous celebrities who participated. Equally arresting are the lesser known: fellow artists, friends, favorite models, and children. "Some Women" reveals the full extent of Mapplethorpe\'s mastery of black-and-white photography and his gift as a portraitist.<br /><br />In her introduction, Joan Didion probes the relationship between the artist and his subject, observing that "there was always about Robert Mapplethorpe an astonishing convergence of quite traditional romantic impulses There was the romance of the apparently conventional. There was the romance of art for its own sake" "Some Women" is the work of an assured photographer. It is an essential part of Robert Mapplethorpe\'s legacy.<br /><br />Robert Mapplethorpe was born in New York in 1946 and received a B.F.A. from the PrattInstitute in 1970; he died in March 1989. His portraits, self-portraits, and photographs of nudes, sculptured objects, flowers, and still lifes have had an undeniable impact on the art world. In 1988 he achieved the greatest recognition of any photographer of the past decade in two major independent retrospectives: at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York and the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia.<br /><br />Mapplethorpe\'s photographs have appeared in nearly two hundred solo and group exhibitions and hang in major collections worldwide. His publications include "Lady: Lisa Lyon" (1983) "Certain People" (1985) "Black Book" (1986) "Robert Mapplethorpe" (1988)and "Flowers" (1990)'

The groundbreaking Tropic of Cancer published by Jack Kahane in 1934 after Anais Nin helped cover costs, its followup Tropic of Capricorn, finally printed in 1939, and Black Spring, a collection of vignettes and tales from 1936. These three works, later republished by the Olympia Press in Paris announced the arrival of a bold, pugilistic, voice on the literary scene, one whose artistic roar echos to this day."

The Poetry is in the pity'. All of his important poems were written in just over a year, and 'Dulce et Decorum Est', 'S.I.W.', 'Futility' and 'Anthem for Doomed Youth' still have an astonishing power to move the reader. Owen pointed out that 'All a poet can do today is to warn. That is why all true Poets must be truthful'. His warning was based on his acute observation of the soldiers with whom he served on the Western Front, and his poems reflect the horror and the waste of the First World War.<br /><br />This volume contains all Owen's best-known poems, only four of which were published in his lifetime. He was killed a week before the Armistice in November 1918."

This is the life and death of a famous mother and her almost-famous son; theirs is a world of sexual extremes--even of sexual assassinations. It is a novel rich with "lunacy and sorrow"; yet the dark, violent events of the story do not undermine a comedy both ribald and robust. In more than thirty languages, in more than forty countries--with more than ten million copies in print--this novel provides almost cheerful, even hilarious evidence of its famous last line: "In the world according to Garp, we are all terminal cases."<br /><br /><i>The World According to Garp</i> is a comic and compassionate coming-of-age novel that established John Irving as one of the most imaginative writers of his generation.

The Marquise (1759-1807), born Adrienne de Noailles, shared the same controversial beliefs as her husband, supporting and defending him wholeheartedly despite ongoing political persecution-including the Marquis's exile in an Austrian dungeon and her own imprisonment (and near-execution) by French radicals. Employing a sweeping, classical feel, and visiting landscapes including the magnificent court at Versailles, the brutal hardship of Valley Forge, and the momentous storming of the Bastille, Lane chronicles and celebrates the couple's passionate yet tumultuous relationship while documenting the birth of America, two French Revolutions, and the Napoleonic era."

Now the Vancouver author returns Gillian to her faculty post as head of the History Department at the University of the Pacific Northwest where sexism has reared its ugly head in attacks on the Feminist ("Eff Yours") Union. Though separated from her lover Edward, a Scotland Yard man, Gillian hasn\'t lost her sleuthing skills. While others see the nasty acts as student pranks, she finds a larger pattern of discrimination developing which leads to a prize-student--and radical feminist--losing a valuable fellowship she was expected to win. But worse is to come: Rita is murdered. Gillian\'s dilemma becomes whether to look for a personal, or a professional, motive.... <br />Adroitly plotted, filled with intrigue and intriguing characters, My Sister\'s Keeper solves the crimes but leaves the mystery of Gillian, poised between her career in Vancouver and her romance in England, not to mention worry about her mother in upstate New York, open. <br />We publish Bad Chemistry in August, Gillian\'s third case.

S'From the earliest years of the American republic, Paris has provoked an extraordinary American literary response. An almost inevitable destination for writers and thinkers, Paris has been many things to many Americans: a tradition-bound bastion of the old world of Europe; a hotbed of revolutionary ideologies in politics and art; and a space in which to cultivate an openness to life and love thought impossible at home. Including stories, letters, memoirs, and journalism, "Americans in Paris" distills three centuries of vigorous, glittering, and powerfully emotional writing about the place that Henry James called ?the most brilliant city in the world.? American writers came to Paris as statesmen, soldiers, students, tourists, and sometimes they stayed as expatriates. This anthology ranges from the crucial early impressions of Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin to the latter-day reflections of writers as varied as James Baldwin, Isadora Duncan, and Jack Kerouac. Along the way we encounter the energetic travelers of the nineteenth century?Emerson, Mark Twain, Henry James?and the pilgrims of the twentieth: Gertrude Stein, F. Scott Fitzgerald, E. E. Cummings, Cole Porter, Henry Miller. Come along as Thomas Paine takes a direct and dangerous part in the French Revolution; Harriet Beecher Stowe tours the Louvre; Theodore Dreiser samples the sensual enticements of Parisian night life; Edith Wharton movingly describes Paris in the early days of World War I; John Dos Passos charts the gathering political storms of the 1930s; Paul Zweig recalls the intertwined pleasures of language and sex; and A.

After a while I thought it would be nice to have pictures of all these beautiful animals. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Waiting for the perfect shot takes patience and time. How do you decide what images are worth waiting for? </p><p><strong>Marent:</strong> I mostly focus on the colorful and spectacularly shaped creatures. Sometimes it is a matter of luck to find them, but sometimes I have to know where and when to look for them. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> What photo in <i>Rainforest</i> is your favorite? </p><p><strong>Marent:</strong> I don't have one favorite--there are many favorites! I especially like the photos of frogs, butterflies, fungi, birds and weird insects. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> What would people find most surprising about the world's rainforests? </p><p><strong>Marent:</strong> When people think of the rainforest, it's the monkeys, birds, and wild cats that first come to mind. But there are so many small and beautiful creatures. We need to see and appreciate them too--they're just a little harder to find! Many of these smaller creatures have never been seen by most people. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Do you consider yourself a rainforest activist? </p><p><strong>Marent:</strong> With the book I want to show to the people the endless beauty of the rainforests. I do hope that it might open the eyes of some people, so that they'll agree that it's worth protecting this fantastic environment. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Some of the photos in the book, especially some of the insect photos, are really strange and otherworldly. What's your favorite exotic rainforest animal? </p><p><strong>Marent:</strong> Some of my favorites always were frogs and butterflies, but birds and monkeys as well. And of course the weird-looking insects. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> What's your favorite rainforest? </p><p><strong>Marent:</strong> In Asia it is Borneo. In Africa it is Madagascar. In Latin America it is Costa Rica and Peru/Colombia. But I also like the Australian and New Zealand rainforests. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Do you have any advice for amateur nature photographers? </p><p><strong>Marent:</strong> A tripod is an absolutely must. Try to move to the animals slowly and quietly--it takes some patience. Whenever possible try taking your pictures at the animal's eye level. And it's always important to think about the background when you compose the picture. </p>"

S"Writing in the June 1965 issue of the<i>Economic Journal</i>, Harry G. Johnson begins with a sentence seemingly calibrated to the scale of the book he set himself to review: -The long-awaited monetary history of the United States by Friedman and Schwartz is in every sense of the term a monumental scholarly achievement--monumental in its sheer bulk, monumental in the definitiveness of its treatment of innumerable issues, large and small . . . monumental, above all, in the theoretical and statistical effort and ingenuity that have been brought to bear on the solution of complex and subtle economic issues.-<br /><br />Friedman and Schwartz marshaled massive historical data and sharp analytics to support the claim that monetary policy--steady control of the money supply--matters profoundly in the management of the nation's economy, especially in navigating serious economic fluctuations. In their influential chapter 7, <i>The Great Contraction</i>--which Princeton published in 1965 as a separate paperback--they address the central economic event of the century, the Depression. According to Hugh Rockoff, writing in January 1965: -If Great Depressions could be prevented through timely actions by the monetary authority (or by a monetary rule), as Friedman and Schwartz had contended, then the case for market economies was measurably stronger.-<br /><br />Milton Friedman won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1976 for work related to <i>A Monetary History</i> as well as to his other Princeton University Press book, <i>A Theory of the Consumption Function</i> (1957)."

But few of their readers and fans know about the important and complex friendship between Tolkien and his fellow Oxford academic C.S. Lewis. Without the persistent encouragement of his friend, Tolkien would never have completed The Lord of the Rings. This great tale, along with the connected matter of The Silmarillion, would have remained merely a private hobby. Likewise, all of Lewis' fiction, after the two met at Oxford University in 1926, bears the mark of Tolkien's influence, whether in names he used or in the creation of convincing fantasy worlds. They quickly discovered their affinity--a love of language and the imagination, a wide reading in northern myth and fairy tale, a desire to write stories themselves in both poetry and prose. Both Tolkien and Lewis were central figures in the informal Oxford literary circle, the Inklings. This book explores their lives, unfolding the extraordinary story of their complex friendship that lasted, with its ups and downs, until Lewis's death in 1963. Despite their differences, what united them was, a shared vision that continues to inspire their millions of readers throughout the world."

S'The art of Joan Didion compels us to consider one essential question: What is the moral significance of our nation\'s mythic and historic quest for paradise in American culture today? The author\'s relentless exploration of this frontier leads through the wasteland of despair and chaos that she sees in modern America. Didion\'s steady gaze at the disorder provides her with the themes she needs for the stories she tells. Her stories are -Western- stories: they are about America\'s moral wilderness; her protagonists are women who pioneer their way through this territory and find the inner resources they need to survive the experience of their modern-day lives.<br /> Didion\'s achievement as a writer lies in her ability to use biblical images to tell her story of the wilderness. This technique challenges the reader to seek out not only the meaning of our individual experience, but also the significance of the American community poised between its original vision of order and purpose and its contemporary condition of breakdown and failure. Yet, Didion\'s bleak version of this frontier story is not without hope. From the broken images of despair and disorder emerges what, for Didion, is always the narrative force of her western story: -...the wilderness was and is redemptive.-"'

Miller offers an enlightening introduction to dreams in history, dream types (spiritual, mixed, and allegorical), and to prescient dreams that provide a privileged glimpse into the future. The visual symbols themselves, accompanied by an array of splendid color drawings, photographs, and boxed sidebars, are divided into elegantly logical categories, from the animal kingdom to rocks and minerals, body and soul to birth and death, food and drink to clothes and jewelry. Everything is extensively cross-referenced, making it easy to look up the thousands of dream elements and solve the mysteries buried deep in the unconscious."

S"There are those who say that the Reverend Sydney Smith ought to be made a saint of the Church of England. There are those who say that he jested away his chances of a mitre. There are those who simply read him and laugh. Sydney Smith was not only a humorist. He was a respected clergyman who worked steadily for Roman Catholic emancipation despite his own staunch Anglicanism. In 1802 he helped to found The Edinburgh Review, which became one of the most powerful journals in Britain. Lord Macaulay referred to him as 'The Smith of Smiths'. Jane Austen is thought to have based Henry Tilner in Northanger Abbey on him. G. K. Chesterton was another of his admirers. This book gathers together a selection of Smith's own writings together with extracts from his daughter's biography of him. Arranged thematically, the passages deal with Home and Abroad, Politics, Social Evils, Education, Religion, and Health and Happiness. As well as Sydney's renowned wit, the collection enshrines the wisdom of a man of enormous common sense and the preaching of an eloquent orator. We discover the sloth, who 'moves suspended, rests suspended, sleeps suspended, and passes his life in suspense - like a young clergyman distantly related to a bishop.' We meet the bishop who 'deserved to be preached to death by wild curates.' But most of all, we enjoy the company of a man determined that 'as long as I can possibly avoid it I will never be unhappy.' The 'amusing defender of our faith' described a friend's idea of heaven as 'eating patC de foie gras to the sound of trumpets.' His present-day admirers may disagree, finding their ideal of heaven in reading this wonderfully entertaining book. Read an Extract from the Introduction here."

But the reality of Mexico has always been obscured behind a variety of masks-of piety, pride, courage, gaiety, indifference and stoicism. In this provocative and insightful book internationally known author Boye Lafayette De Mente goes behind the masks that have long obscured Mexico to reveal the cultural influences that created the character and personality of Mexicans, and provides guidelines for dealing with them."

p3110
(lp3111
S"A radical abolitionist and early feminist, Francis George Shaw (1809-1882) was a prominent figure in American reform and intellectual circles for five decades. He rejected capitalism in favor of a popular utopian socialist movement. During the Civil War and Reconstruction, he applied his radical principles to the Northern war effort and to freedmen's organizations. A partnership with Henry George in the late 1870s provided an international audience for Shaw's alternative vision of society.<br />Seeking the One Great Remedy is the biography of this remarkable and influential man. In compelling detail, author Lorien Foote depicts the exploits of the Shaw family. Their activities provide a perspective on the course of American reform that calls into question previous interpretations of the reform movements of this period.<br />Francis George Shaw is perhaps best known as the father of Robert Gould Shaw, Captain of the Fifty-fourth Massachusetts, a black regiment in the Union army, and subject of the movie Glory. Francis and his wife, Sarah Blake Shaw, achieved considerable notoriety for their activities, including their effort to shape public opinion during the Civil War. Turning their son's tragic death at Fort Wagner into a public relations and propaganda triumph, they altered Northern opinion about the war and shaped a historical perception of the famous Fifty-fourth Massachusetts that continues today.<br />Seeking the One Great Remedy argues that social radicalism was pervasive among elite reformers before and after the Civil War and finds in the dramatic story of Francis George Shaw a model of that cause."

This book is aimed at redefining the parameters of disabilities so as to illustrate that all persons are in fact created equal under God. The aim of the book is to illustrate that chromosomes should not be utilized as a formative factor in someone\'s mentality and just because someone doesn\'t look or act "normal" does not make them any less of a person. Disabilities are turned into abilities and the reader is prompted to find an alternative way of viewing reality and reading everyday signs. Readers are impelled to observe how they see the reflection of their own selves in others, especially their own children. Using a play on words as well as biblical reference and personal narration, languages are decoded and brought together in hopes of shedding light on the damaging effects that we as "gods" (posing as parents, siblings, medical professionals, and friends) have on others as a human race.

S"<i>Pale Fire</i> is regarded by many as Vladimir Nabokov's masterpiece. The novel has been hailed as one of the most striking early examples of postmodernism and has become a famous test case for theories about reading because of the apparent impossibility of deciding between several radically different interpretations. Does the book have two narrators, as it first appears, or one? How much is fantasy and how much is reality? Whose fantasy and whose reality are they? Brian Boyd, Nabokov's biographer and hitherto the foremost proponent of the idea that <i>Pale Fire</i> has one narrator, John Shade, now rejects this position and presents a new and startlingly different solution that will permanently shift the nature of critical debate on the novel. Boyd argues that the book does indeed have two narrators, Shade and Charles Kinbote, but reveals that Kinbote had some strange and highly surprising help in writing his sections. In light of this interpretation<i>, Pale Fire</i> now looks distinctly less postmodern--and more interesting than ever.<br /><br />In presenting his arguments, Boyd shows how Nabokov designed <i>Pale Fire</i> for readers to make surprising discoveries on a first reading and even more surprising discoveries on subsequent readings by following carefully prepared clues within the novel. Boyd leads the reader step-by-step through the book, gradually revealing the profound relationship between Nabokov's ethics, aesthetics, epistemology, and metaphysics. If Nabokov has generously planned the novel to be accessible on a first reading and yet to incorporate successive vistas of surprise, Boyd argues, it is because he thinks a deep generosity lies behind the inexhaustibility, complexity, and mystery of the world. Boyd also shows how Nabokov's interest in discovery springs in part from his work as a scientist and scholar, and draws comparisons between the processes of readerly and scientific discovery.<br /><br />This is a profound, provocative, and compelling reinterpretation of one of the greatest novels of the twentieth century."

While self-conscious about fiction-making, it takes seriously the condition of the society in which it is produced.<br />Attwell begins by describing the intellectual and political contexts surrounding Coetzee\'s fiction and then provides a developmental analysis of his six novels, drawing on Coetzee\'s other writings in stylistics, literary criticism, translation, political journalism and popular culture. Elegantly written, Attwell\'s analysis deals with both Coetzee\'s subversion of the dominant culture around him and his ability to see the complexities of giving voice to the anguish of South Africa.'

S"Tolkien: A Look Behind The Lord of the Rings is a study of the works of J.R.R. Tolkien written by Lin Carter. It was 1st published in paper by Ballantine in 3/69 &amp; went thru numerous additional printings. It was among the earliest full-length critical works devoted to Tolkien's fantasies, the 1st to set his writings in their proper context in the history of fantasy. It was the earliest of three studies by Carter devoted to fantasy/horror writers &amp; the history of fantasy, being followed by Lovecraft: A Look Behind the Cthulhu Mythos ('72) &amp; Imaginary Worlds: The Art of Fantasy ('73), establishing him as an authority on the genre, indirectly leading to his editorial guidance of the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series. Gollancz published a cloth edition updated by Adam Roberts in 8/03.<br /> The study serves as an introduction for those unfamiliar with Tolkien's work. An introduction briefly reviews the publishing phenomenon of The Lord of the Rings &amp; its popularity in the wake of the 1st paper editions in the '60s, after which he devotes three chapters to a short biography of the author thru the late '60s, including an account of how it was written. Four chapters explaining Middle-earth &amp; summarizing the stories of The Hobbit &amp; the three volumes of The Lord of the Rings follow, for the benefit of readers who may not have actually read the works. Carter next turns to the question of what the works are, a point of some confusion at the time. The then-current vogue for realistic fiction provided critics with few tools for evaluating an out-&amp;-out fantasy on its own terms. Attempts to deconstruct it as a satire or allegory were rife. Carter firmly debunks these efforts, supporting his argument by drawing on Tolkien's own published ruminations on fantasy's functions &amp; purposes. He then contextualizes the works by sketching the history of written fantasy from its earliest appearance in the epic poetry of the ancient world thru the heroic poetry of the Dark &amp; the prose romances of the Middle Ages, down to the fairy tales, ghost stories &amp; gothic novels of the early modern era &amp; the rediscovery of the genre by writers of the 19-20th centuries prior to &amp; contemporary with Tolkien. The origins of the modern genre are discovered in the writings of Wm Morris, Lord Dunsany &amp; E.R. Eddison &amp; followed thru the works of authors they influenced, including H.P. Lovecraft, Fletcher Pratt, L. Sprague de Camp &amp; Mervyn Peake. Carter next highlights some of Tolkien's particular debts to his predecessors, tracing the motifs &amp; names he utilizes back to their beginnings in Norse mythology &amp; highlighting other echoes in his work deriving from legend &amp; history. Finally noted is Tolkien's influence on contemporary fantasy, which was just beginning to make itself felt, primarily in the juvenile fantasies of Carol Kendall, Alan Garner &amp; Lloyd Alexander."

For the next two years she asked herself questions about time, reality, sacrifice death, and the will of God. In <em>Holy the Firm</em> she writes about a moth consumed in a candle flame, about a seven-year-old girl burned in an airplane accident, about a baptism on a cold beach. But behind the moving curtain of what she calls "the hard things -- rock mountain and salt sea," she sees, sometimes far off and sometimes as close by as a veil or air, the power play of holy fire.<br /><br />This is a profound book about the natural world -- both its beauty and its cruelty -- the Pulitzer Prize-winning Dillard knows so well.'

The abstract provided by the Pentagon follows: The use of quantitative structure property relationships (QSPRs) is proposed for the calculation of dielectric constants. A data set of 497 compounds with a wide variety of functional groups is assembled. These compounds span the dielectric constant range of 1-40. A total of 65 molecular descriptors is calculated for these compounds. These descriptors include the dipole moment, polarizability, counts of elemental types, an mediator of hydrogen bonding capability, charged partial surface area descriptors, and molecular connectivity descriptors. Subsets of these descriptors are used to build models in an attempt to find the best possible correlation between chemical structure and dielectric constant. A total of 70,000 models is examined. Neural networks using the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) training algorithm are employed to build the models. A total of 191 models has test set errors less than 2.0 and training set errors less than 3.0, where the errors are calculated as the mean of the absolute values of the residuals for sets of 97 and 350 compounds, respectively.'

The book movingly chronicles her childhood in a loving, untraditional family, her upbringing before the Revolution in 1979 that toppled the Shah, her marriage and her religious faith, as well as her life as a mother and lawyer battling an oppressive regime in the courts while bringing up her girls at home. <br />Outspoken, controversial, Shirin Ebadi is one of the most fascinating women today. She rose quickly to become the first female judge in the country; but when the religious authorities declared women unfit to serve as judges she was demoted to clerk in the courtroom she had once presided over. She eventually fought her way back as a human rights lawyer, defending women and children in politically charged cases that most lawyers were afraid to represent. She has been arrested and been the target of assassination, but through it all has spoken out with quiet bravery on behalf of the victims of injustice and discrimination and become a powerful voice for change, almost universally embraced as a hero. <br />Her memoir is a gripping story - a must-read for anyone interested in Zara Kazemi's case, in the life of a remarkable woman, or in understandingthe political and religious upheaval in our world."

She also offers her independent reflections. Examining the three phases of time, past, present, and future, she argues that neither external time nor the time of the human past is real: the one is a comparison of motions and the other a projection of memory. She concludes that true time is internal and has its origin in the imaginative structure of memory and expectation.

The problem is, the meaning is in the symbols found in the dream. To fully understand the dream you have to understand its symbols. And one of the best ways to do this is by using Ray Buckland\'s "Gypsy Dream Dictionary "(an expanded version of "Secrets of Gypsy Dream Reading). <br />"The meanings of over 850 different symbols that commonly appear in dreams are given. Did you dream of a wide, straight road? That means things will come to you easily. Did you dream of a grasshopper? That is a bad sign, indicating financial losses to come. Did you dream of yourself wielding an axe? That means you are respected for your position. You will also learn how to pick the important symbols from your dreams in order to interpret them. <br />If this book just gave the meanings of dreams, it could prove vitally important to your spiritual development. But it goes beyond that and provides a basic introduction to dream sciences. In this book, you will learn the secrets of how to recognize prophetic dreams and how to make money with your dreaming abilities. You will also learn how to enjoy the experience of knowing that you are dreaming (lucid dreaming). <br />This book has been updated to include some important symbols which wouldn\'t have even been considered years ago. From TV to the internet, movies to computers, it\'s all here! <br />Now is the time for you to find out what your dreams mean. They could save your life or help you reach financial stability.

The serial chronicled the adventures of D'Artagnan -- a young swordsman intent on joining the king's musketeers. Young D'Artagnan becomes embroiled in court intrigues, international politics, and ill-fated affairs between royal lovers. As this third serial begins, it is now 1660, and although promised the captaincy of the musketeers at the close of _Twenty Years After, _ D'Artagnan is still trailing his sword in the Louvre as a lowly lieutenant. Louis XIV is well past the age where he should rule, but the ailing Cardinal Mazarin refuses to relinquish the reins of power. Meanwhile, Charles II, a king without a country, travels Europe seeking aid from his fellow monarchs. Athos still resides at La FEre while his son, Raoul de Bragelonne, has entered into the service in the household of M. le Prince. As for Raoul, he has his eyes on an entirely different object than his father -- his childhood companion, Louise de la ValliEre, with whom he is hopelessly in love.

S"With the publication of Liberty Tree, acclaimed historian Alfred F. Young presents a selection of his seminal writing as well as two provocative, never-before-published essays. Together, they take the reader on a journey through the American Revolution, exploring the role played by ordinary women and men (called, at the time, people out of doors) in shaping events during and after the Revolution, their impact on the Founding generation of the new American nation, and finally how this populist side of the Revolution has fared in public memory.<br /><br />Drawing on a wide range of sources, which include not only written documents but also material items like powder horns, and public rituals like parades and tarring and featherings, Young places ordinary Americans at the center of the Revolution. For example, in one essay he views the Constitution of 1787 as the result of an intentional accommodation by elites with non-elites, while another piece explores the process of ongoing negotiations would-be rulers conducted with the middling sort; women, enslaved African Americans, and Native Americans. Moreover, questions of history and modern memory are engaged by a compelling examination of icons of the Revolution, such as the pamphleteer Thomas Paine and Boston's Freedom Trail.<br /><br />For over forty years, history lovers, students, and scholars alike have been able to hear the voices and see the actions of ordinary people during the Revolutionary Era, thanks to Young's path-breaking work, which seamlessly blends sophisticated analysis with compelling and accessible prose. From his award-winning work on mechanics, or artisans, in the seaboard cities of the Northeast to the all but forgotten liberty tree, a major popular icon of the Revolution explored in depth for the first time, Young continues to astound readers as he forges new directions in the history of the American Revolution."

It is a rich and brilliant chronicle of life and death, and the tragicomedy of humankind. In the noble, ridiculous, beautiful, and tawdry story of the family, one sees all of humanity, just as in the history, myths, growth, and decay of Macondo, one sees all of Latin America.<br /><br />Love and lust, war and revolution, riches and poverty, youth and senility -- the variety of life, the endlessness of death, the search for peace and truth -- these universal themes dominate the novel. Whether he is describing an affair of passion or the voracity of capitalism and the corruption of government, Gabriel Garcia Marquez always writes with the simplicity, ease, and purity that are the mark of a master.<br /><br />Alternately reverential and comical, <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> weaves the political, personal, and spiritual to bring a new consciousness to storytelling.

p3506
(lp3507
S'A brilliant synthesis of the Apostle Paul\'s thought and influence, written by a ?foremost Catholic intellectual? ("Chicago Tribune") <br /> All through history, Christians have debated Paul\'s influence on the church. Though revered, Paul has also been a stone on which many stumble. Apocryphal writings by Peter and James charge Paul, in the second century, with being a tool of Satan. In later centuries Paul became a target of ridicule for writers such as Thomas Jefferson (?the first corruptor ?), George Bernard Shaw (?a monstrous imposition?), and Nietzsche (?the Dysangelist?). However, as Garry Wills argues eloquently in this masterly analysis, what Paul meant was not something contrary to what Jesus meant. Rather, the best way to know Jesus is to discover Paul. Unlike the Gospel writers, who carefully shaped their narratives many decades after Jesus? life, Paul wrote in the heat of the moment, managing controversy, and sometimes contradicting himself, but at the same time offering the best reflection of those early times. "What Paul Meant" is a stellar interpretation of Paul\'s writing, examining his tremendous influence on the first explosion of Christian belief and chronicling the controversy surrounding Paul through the centuries. Wills\'s many readers and those interested in the Christian tradition will warmly welcome this penetrating discussion of perhaps the most fascinating church father.'

This evil will be still greater if the laws be written in a language unknown to the people; who, being ignorant of the consequences of their own actions, become necessarily dependent on a few, who are interpreters of the laws, which, instead of being public and general, are thus rendered private and particular.'

S'By the dawn of the nineteenth century, "elements" had been defined as basic building blocks of nature resistant to decomposition by chemical means. In 1869, the Russian chemist Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev organized the discord of the elements into the periodic table, assigning each element to a row, with each row corresponding to an elemental category. The underlying order of matter, hitherto only dimly perceived, was suddenly clearly revealed.<br />This is the first English-language collection of Mendeleev\'s most important writings on the periodic law. Thirteen papers and essays, divided into three groups, reflect the period corresponding to the initial establishment of the periodic law (three papers: 1869-71), a period of priority disputes and experimental confirmations (five papers: 1871-86), and a final period of general acceptance for the law and increasing international recognition for Mendeleev (five papers: 1887-1905). A single, easily accessible source for Mendeleev\'s principle papers, this volume offers a history of the development of the periodic law, written by the law\'s own founder.'

Focusing on the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, but with an eye toward antiquity and the present, Caroline Walker Bynum explores the themes of metamorphosis and hybridity in genres ranging from poetry, folktales, and miracle collections to scholastic theology, devotional treatises, and works of natural philosophy. She argues that the obsession with boundary-crossing and otherness was an effort to delineate nature's regularities and to establish a strong sense of personal identity, extending even beyond the grave. She examines historical figures such as Marie de France, Gerald of Wales, Bernard Clairvaux, Thomas Aquinas, and Dante, as well as modern fabulists such as Angela Carter, as examples of solutions to the perennial question of how the individual can both change and remain constant. Addressing the fundamental question for historians--that of change--Bynum also explores the nature of history writing itself."

A biologist who has spent 20 years working in the rainforest, Forsyth has observed firsthand the ravaging effects of agricultural, economic and environmental policies on an ecosystem under siege.<br /><br />Yet in this collection of essays, he has chosen to celebrate the rainforest rather than to lament its loss. The rainforest plays a variety of roles -- as a genetic reservoir, a pharmacy of natural products and a carbon dioxide exchange system -- but for Forsyth, its true value rests with something less functional. The rainforest, he argues, represents the pinnacle of biological diversity and evolutionary sophistication on this planet.<br /><br />Forsyth draws on his own extensive experience in the rainforest to make this fascinating habitat tangible for his readers. The result is a creative, anecdotal text that in each chapter follows a thread of adaptive Darwinian logic through some part of the rainforest.

(lp3667
S'One of America\'s most noted contemporary novelists, John Irving has created a body of fiction of extraordinary range, moving with ease from romance to fairytale to thriller. Although his fiction follows in the tradition of the great 19th-century world novelists, he is a quintessential American writer--his novels are laced with broad humor, farce, and absurd situations. He does not hesitate to tackle the troubling issues that have faced our nation in the past few decades, such as war, racism, sexism, abortion, violence, and AIDS. This study offers a clear, accessible reading of Irving\'s fiction. It analyzes in turn all of his novels from "Setting Free the Bears" (1968) to his newest novel "A Widow for One Year" (1998). It also provides the reader with a complete bibliography of Irving\'s fiction, as well as selected reviews and criticism.<br /><br />Following a biographical chapter on Irving\'s life, an overview of his fiction explores his work in light of his literary heritage and use of a variety of genres. Each of the following chapters examines an individual novel: "Setting Free the Bears" (1968), "The Water-Method Man" (1972), "The 158-Pound Marriage" (1973), "The World According to Garp" (1976), "The Hotel New Hampshire" (1981), " The Cider House Rules" (1985), "A Prayer for Owen Meany" (1989), "A Son of the Circus" (1994), and "A Widow for One Year" (1998). The discussion of each novel includes sections on plot and character development, thematic issues, and a new and fresh critical approach from which to read the novel. Campbell explores the great moral range in Irving\'s novels. She shows that all his novels deal with a character\'s quest to discover the self, a journey of raw energy that touches us because we recognize it as our own. This study will help readers to appreciate the experimental fiction that is Irving\'s trademark and his ability to capture the essence of American life in the last part of the twentieth century.'

S'By the nationally best-selling author of "The Seven Daughters of Eve," "Adam\'s Curse" investigates the ultimate evolutionary crisis: a man-free future. How is it possible that the Y chromosome, which separated the sexes and allowed humans to rise to the apex of the animal kingdom, also threatens to destroy sexual reproduction altogether? Bryan Sykes confronts recent advances in evolutionary theory to find the answers to the questions that inexorably follow: Is there a genetic cause for men\'s greed, aggression, and promiscuity? Could a male homosexual gene possibly exist? A must read for anyone interested in popular science, family genealogy, and today\'s infertility crisis, "Adam\'s Curse" provokes a shocking debate on the nature of sexual reproduction.'

S"From one of America's iconic writers, this is a portrait of a marriage and a life - in good times and bad - that will speak to anyone who has ever loved a husband or wife or child. This is a stunning book of electric honesty and passion. Several days before Christmas 2003, John Gregory Dunne and Joan Didion saw their only daughter, Quintana, fall ill.<br /><br />At first they thought it was flu, then pneumonia, then complete septic shock. She was put into an induced coma and placed on life support. Days later - the night before New Year's Eve - the Dunnes were just sitting down to dinner after visiting the hospital when John suffered a massive and fatal coronary.<br /><br />In a second, this close, symbiotic partnership of 40 years was over. Four weeks later, their daughter pulled through. Two months after that, arriving at LA airport, she collapsed and underwent six hours of brain surgery at UCLA Medical Centre to relieve a massive hematoma.<br /><br />This powerful book is Didion's 'attempt to make sense of the weeks and then months that cut loose any fixed idea I ever had about death, about illness, about marriage and children and memory, about the shallowness of sanity, about life itself'. The result is an exploration of an intensely personal yet universal experience: a portrait of a marriage, and a life, in good times and bad."

S"When a plane crashes on a remote island, a small group of schoolboys are the sole survivors. From the prophetic Simon and virtuous Ralph to the lovable Piggy and brutish Jack, each of the boys attempts to establish control as the reality - and brutal savagery - of their situation sets in.<br /><br />The boys' struggle to find a way of existing in a community with no fixed boundaries invites readers to evaluate the concepts involved in social and political constructs and moral frameworks. Ideas of community, leadership, and the rule of law are called into question as the reader has to consider who has a right to power, why, and what the consequences of the acquisition of power may be. Often compared to <i>Catcher in the Rye</i>, <i>Lord of the Flies</i> also represents a coming-of-age story of innocence lost."

S"I do not know of any other work which surveys the whole range of 19th- and 20th-century Persian prose writing in this way--from the travel accounts (safarnamehs) of the 19th century down to the present day. Of especial interest and importance to Western readers is the author's analysis of post-revolutionary writing. --roger m. savory, professor emeritus of middle eastern and islamic studies, university of toronto The extreme anti-Western actions and attitudes of Iranians in the past decade have astonished and dismayed the West, which has characterized the Iranian positions as irrational and inexplicable. In this groundbreaking study of images of the West in Iranian literature, however, M. R. Ghanoonparvar reveals that these attitudes did not develop suddenly or inexplicably but rather evolved over more than two centuries of Persian-Western contact. Notable among the authors whose works Ghanoonparvar discusses are Sadeq Hedayat, M. A. Jamalzadeh, Hushang Golshiri, Gholamhoseyn Sa'edi, Simin Daneshvar, Moniru Ravanipur, Sadeq Chubak, and Jalal Al-e Ahmad. This survey significantly illuminates the sources of Iranian attitudes toward the West and offers many surprising discoveries for Western readers, not least of which is the fact that Iranians have often found Westerners to be as enigmatic and incomprehensible as we have believed them to be."
