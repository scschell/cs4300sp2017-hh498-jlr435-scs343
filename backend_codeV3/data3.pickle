S'Herbert George Wells was perhaps best known as the author of such classic works of science fiction as <i>The Time Machine </i>and <i>War of the Worlds.</i> But it was in his short stories, written when he was a young man embarking on a literary career, that he first explored the enormous potential of the scientific discoveries of the day. He described his stories as "a miscellany of inventions," yet his enthusiasm for science was tempered by an awareness of its horrifying destructive powers and the threat it could pose to the human race. A consummate storyteller, he made fantastic creatures and machines entirely believable, and by placing ordinary men and women in extraordinary situations, he explored, with humor, what it means to be alive in a century of rapid scientific progress. At the dawn of a new millennium, Wells\' singular vision is more compelling than ever.'

Amy starts her quest at one of the finest small hotels in the French Alps - a hotel noted for skiing and its famous cooking lessons - in the town of Valmeri." "A few days into her trip, Amy is nearly swept away by an avalanche (started, some say, by low-flying American warplanes). Two of the hotel\'s guests, esteemed English publisher Adrian Venn and his much younger American wife, Kerry, were not as fortunate as Amy. Both lie comatose in a nearby hospital. Learning that French and English laws dictate a very different division of money depending on where Adrian dies, Adrian\'s children - young, old, legitimate, and illegitimate - assemble in Valmeri to protect their interests should he not pull through." Amy, already suspect as an American, finds that her nationality freezes the social climate as she steps in to assist the family. In her innocence, Amy sets in motion a series of events in France and England that spotlight ancient national differences, customs, and laws. Add one or two small affairs that may topple carefully balanced alliances, and soon it is, as the French say, a situation.'

Over the last hundred years, commercial graphic design has evolved into increasingly sophisticated strategies in brand identity, repetition, and conceptual advertising. The graphic arts have also emerged from the purely commercial sphere into both political and artistic realms, furthering the reach and uses of this unique art form. Heavily illustrated with archival images, illustrations, and photographs, and with an informative text by graphic arts expert Alain Weill, this book will be the perfect introduction to the societal, artistic, and political uses of graphic design over the last century."

S'Originally published in 1992 to great acclaim, this updated edition traces the course of Hawkinga (TM)s life and science, successfully marrying biography and physics to tell the story of a remarkable man. <br /> Stephen Hawking is no ordinary scientist. With a career that began over thirty years ago at Cambridge University, he has managed to do more than perhaps any other scientist to broaden our basic understanding of the universe. His theoretical work on black holes and his progress in advancing our knowledge of the origin and nature of the cosmos have been groundbreakinga "if not downright revolutionary. <br /> Stephen Hawking has also spent much of his adult life confined to a wheelchair, a victim of ALS, a degenerative motor neuron disease. Clearly his physical limitations have done nothing to confine him intellectually. He simply never allowed his illness to hinder his scientific development. In fact, many would argue that his liberation from the routine chores of life has allowed him to focus his efforts more keenly on his science. <br /> Hawking certainly would have been remarkable for his cutting edge work in theoretical physics alone. However, he has also managed to popularize science in a way unparalleled by other scientists of his stature. He became a household name, achieving almost cult-like fame, with the release of his best-selling book, <i>A Brief History of Time.</i> Although steeped in the potentially overwhelming complexities of cosmology, he succeeded in selling millions of copies to audiences eager to learn even some of what he has to offer. <br /> Science writers White and Gribbin have skillfully painted a portrait of an indefatigable genius and a scientific mind that seemingly knows no bounds. Knitting together clear explanations of Hawkinga (TM)s science with a detailed personal history that is both balanced as well as sensitive, we come to knowa "and appreciatea "both. <br /> As Stephen Hawkinga (TM)s new book, <i>The Universe in a Nutshell, </i> hits the best-seller lists, it is the ideal time for readers to learn more about this remarkable man and his vast body of accomplishments.'

Its dazzling mixture of fantasy and satire is narrated by a personification of Folly, dressed as a jester, who celebrates youth, pleasure, drunkenness and sexual desire, and goes on to lambast human pretensions, foibles and frailties, to mock theologians and monks and to praise the folly' of simple Christian piety.

p86
(lp87
S'"Emergence" is the notion that the whole is more than the sum of its parts. John Holland, a MacArthur Fellow known as the "father of genetic algorithms," says this seemingly simple notion will be at the heart of the development of machines that can think for themselves. And while he claims that he\'d rather do science than write about it, this is his second scientific philosophy book intended to increase public understanding of difficult concepts (his first was <i>Hidden Order: How Adaptation Builds Complexity</i>). One of the questions that Holland says emergence theory can help answer is: can we build systems from which more comes out than was put in? Think of the food replicators in the imaginary future of <i>Star Trek</i>--with some basic chemical building blocks and simple rules, those machines can produce everything from Klingon delicacies to Earl Grey tea. If scientists can understand and apply the knowledge they gather from studying emergent systems, we may soon witness the development of artificial intelligence, nanotech, biological machines, and other creations heretofore confined to science fiction. Using games, molecules, maps, and scientific theories as examples, Holland outlines how emergence works, emphasizing the interrelationships of simple rules and parts in generating a complex whole. Because of the theoretical depth, this book probably won\'t appeal to the casual reader of popular science, but those interested in delving a little deeper into the future of science and engineering will be fascinated. Holland\'s writing, while sometimes self-consciously precise, is clear, and he links his theoretical arguments to examples in the real world whenever possible. Emergence offers insight not just to scientific advancement, but across many areas of human endeavor--business, the arts, even the evolution of society and the generation of new ideas. <i>--Therese Littleton</i>'

The Notebook is an achingly tender story about the enduring power of love, a story of miracles that will stay with you forever. Set amid the austere beauty of coastal North Carolina in 1946, The Notebook begins with the story of Noah Calhoun, a rural Southerner returned home from World War II. Noah, thirty-one, is restoring a plantation home to its former glory, and he is haunted by images of the beautiful girl he met fourteen years earlier, a girl he loved like no other. Unable to find her, yet unwilling to forget the summer they spent together, Noah is content to live with only memories. . . until she unexpectedly returns to his town to see him once again. Allie Nelson, twenty-nine, is now engaged to another man, but realizes that the original passion she felt for Noah has not dimmed with the passage of time. Still, the obstacles that once ended their previous relationship remain, and the gulf between their worlds is too vast to ignore. With her impending marriage only weeks away, Allie is forced to confront her hopes and dreams for the future, a future that only she can shape. Like a puzzle within a puzzle, the story of Noah and Allie is just beginning. As it unfolds, their tale miraculously becomes something different, with much higher stakes. The result is a deeply moving portrait of love itself, the tender moments, and fundamental changes that affect us all. Shining with a beauty that is rarely found in current literature, The Notebook establishes Nicholas Sparks as a classic storyteller with a unique insight into the only emotion that really matters.<br /><br /><i>Did You Know?---<br /><br />The Notebook was only the third novel in recent history to spend over a year as a hardcover best-seller?<br />One of the poems by Walt Whitman quoted in the novel is entitled "To a Common Prostitute?"<br />The title for the novel was chosen by Theresa Park, Nicholas\'s agent?</i>'

It\'s not much different than the dot.com mania or the corporate scams that heat up over a century later. Unfortunately for Joe Rose, a precious-metals assayer, death stakes its own claim. Joe\'s body is found trampled into the muck behind Inez Stannert\'s saloon. Inez already had much more to deal with than pouring shots of Taos Lightning and cleaning up a corpse. A lady educated on the East Coast, she has a past that doesn\'t bear close scrutiny, including her elopement with a gambling man who has recently disappeared. Most townsfolk, including Inez\'s business partner, Abe Jackson, dismiss Joe\'s death as an accident. Death, after all, is no stranger in Leadville. But Inez wonders: Why was this loving husband and father carrying a brass token good for "one free screw" at the parlor house of Denver madam Mattie Silks? When Joe\'s widow Emma asks Inez to settle Joe\'s affairs, almost against her will, Inez uncovers skewed assays, bogus greenbacks, and blackmail. Lies and secrets run deep in Colorado, secrets more likely to lead to a hanging than to today\'s congressional hearings or country-club prisons for the crooked and the greedy.

In addition to the stories are approximately 300 detailed footnotes which I encourage every reader to explore and verify for themselves. Only by sifting through huge amounts of news data on a daily basis was I able to catch many of these rare \'diamonds in the rough\' and organize them into a coherent pattern and logical argument. "The only logical conclusion is that the 9-11 attacks, the anthrax murders, the Bali bombing, the African embassy bombings and numerous other foiled terror plots, were planned, orchestrated, financed, carried out, and covered up by the forces of international Zionism. "Even in the face of this mountain of logic and evidence, there will be those weaklings who will go into denial and casually dismiss this whole case as just another silly \'anti-Semitic conspiracy theory.\' But the funniest \'conspiracy theory\' of all is that some Saudi caveman and his \'network\' of Arab video game pilots managed to elude US investigators and pull off the most sophisticated intelligence operation in world history. "You can continue to believe that fairy tale if it makes you sleep better at night (and if your sense of credulity can stand the burden!). Or, you can muster the moral and intellectual courage to free your mind from Zionist bondage and face the ugly truth. You can join the \'extremists\' and make a commitment to share the horrible truth with others, or, you can smirk, roll your eyes, and \'pooh-pooh\' everything you\'ve just read.

The two meet and form an unlikely friendship. Appealing to the boy's imagination by telling him the story of the circumnavigation of Australia as seen through Trim's eyes, Billy is drawn deeply into Ryan's life and into the Sydney underworld. Over several months the two begin the mutual process of rehabilitation. Matthew Flinders' Cat is a modern-day story of a city, its crime, the plight of the homeless and the politics of greed and perversion.

p350
(lp351
S"This powerful new reading of <i>Moby-Dick</i> brings into play some of the most consequential theoretical developments of the last three decades in philosophy, cultural studies, and literary criticism. It takes account of four trends in innovative critical thought: recent theories of power, as articulated by Foucault, Deleuze, Butler, and Agamben; theories of trauma and testimony developed by Felman and Caruth; the new thinking of ethics, articulated by Levinas and Derrida; and the new thinking of history developed by New Historicism. All four, the author argues, participate in a groundbreaking new elaboration of the concept of disaster. <i>Moby-Dick's</i> privilege, the author claims, anticipates this new thinking of the disaster and shows that it demands simultaneously a new thinking of the literary. Read from this perspective, Melville's novel can both be illuminated by these recent theoretical developments and, in turn, illuminate them, adding new and complex dimensions to their findings.<br /><br />"

S'A "fresh, funny first novel" "(San Francisco Chronicle)," "Looking For Mo" has garnered rave reviews from critics and readers alike, echoing the success of Daniel Duane\'s previous book, "Caught Inside." This time Duane combines the thrill of adventure writing "a la" Jon Krakauer with a sly satire of pop culture comparable to Douglas Coupland\'s "Generation X," and folds them into a wry and memorable story of one man\'s search for truth on the sheer rock face of Yosemite\'s El Capitan. Raymond Connelly, a San Francisco would-be writer, is still living uneasily with his failure to climb "The Captain" with his childhood friend and alter ego, Mo Lehrman. As he circumnavigates his way through life on the edges of West Coast counterculture, trying to live like Mo\'s stories, which are more real than life itself, Ray lifts the best of those tales for his own book. But when he is accused of plagiarism, Ray suffers an attack of conscience, and sets off in search of Mo -- to explain, and to make good by finishing their shared climb.<br /><br />From the San Francisco performance-art world to a psychedelic vision at a Grateful Dead show, Ray\'s quest for self-discovery is both hilarious and emotionally fraught, climaxing in two men\'s true-to-life climb up the sheer slope of "The Captain." "Looking For Mo" is a moving, resonant exploration of the tenuous foundations of friendship and an investigation of the explosive power of storytelling.'

(lp383
S'America\'s finest eighteenth-century student of political science, John Adams is also the least studied of the Revolution\'s key figures. By the time he became our second president, no American had written more about our government and not even Jefferson or Madison had read as widely about questions of human nature, natural right, political organization, and constitutional construction. Yet this staunch constitutionalist is perceived by many as having become reactionary in his later years and his ideas have been largely disregarded.<br /><br />In the first major work on Adams\'s political thought in over thirty years, C. Bradley Thompson takes issue with the notion that Adams\'s thought is irrelevant to the development of American ideas. Focusing on Adams\'s major writings, Thompson elucidates and reevaluates his political and constitutional thought by interpreting it within the tradition of political philosophy stretching from Plato to Montesquieu.<br /><br />This major revisionist study shows that the distinction Adams drew between "principles of liberty" and "principles of political architecture" is central to his entire political philosophy. Thompson first chronicles Adams\'s conceptualization of moral and political liberty during his confrontation with American Loyalists and British imperial officers over the true nature of justice and the British Constitution, illuminating Adams\'s two most important pre-Revolutionary essays, "A Dissertation on the Canon and Feudal Law" and "The Letters of Novanglus." He then presents Adams\'s debate with French philosophers over the best form of government and provides an extended analysis of his Defense of the Constitutions of Government and Discourses on Davila to demonstrate his theory of political architecture.<br /><br />From these pages emerges a new John Adams. In reexamining his political thought, Thompson reconstructs the contours and influences of Adams\'s mental universe, the ideas he challenged, the problems he considered central to constitution-making, and the methods of his reasoning. Skillfully blending history and political science, Thompson\'s work shows how the spirit of liberty animated Adams\'s life and reestablishes this forgotten Revolutionary as an independent and important thinker.'

S"Miles Ryan's life seemed to end the day his wife was killed in a hit-and-run accident two years ago. Missy had been his first love, and Miles fervently believes she will be his last. As a deputy in the North Carolina town of New Bern, Miles Ryan not only grieves for Missy, but also longs to bring the unknown driver to justice. Then Miles meets Sarah Andrews. The second grade teacher of his son, Jonah, Sarah had left Baltimore after a difficult divorce to start over in the gentler surroundings of New Bern. Perhaps it's her own emotional wounds that make her sensitive to the hurt she first sees in Jonah's eyes, and then his father's. Tentatively, Sarah and Miles reach out to each other. Soon they are both laughing for the first time in years . . . and falling in love. Neither will be able to guess how closely linked they are to a shocking secret -- one that will force them to question everything they ever believed in . . . and make a heartbreaking choice that will change their lives forever."

'My name is Liz Dunn. The Liz Dunns of this world take classes in croissant baking, and would rather chew on soccer balls than deny their children muesli. They own one sex toy, plus one cowboy fantasy that accompanies its use...Look at me: I am a traitor to my name: I'm not cheerful; I'm drab. I'm crabby and friendless. And lonely.' Liz Dunn is 42 years old, and lonely. Her house is like 'a spinster's cell block', and she may or may not snore -- there's never been anybody to tell her. Then one day in 1997, with the comet Hale Bopp burning bright in the blue-black sky, Liz receives an urgent phone call asking her to visit a young man in hospital. All at once, the loneliness that has come to define her is ripped away by this funny, smart, handsome young stranger, Jeremy. Her son. Coupland's finest character yet. Illuminated by a wonderfully gentle, searching wisdom, it sees Coupland ascend to a new level of peace and grace in his ever-more-extraordinary career."

What has come to be known as the Matter of Hannibal inspired two of his most famous books, <i>Tom Sawyer</i> and <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>, and provided the basis for the eleven pieces reprinted here. Most of these selections (eight of them fiction and three of them autobiographical) were never completed, and all were left unpublished. Written between 1868 and 1902, they include a diverse assortment of adventures, satires, and reminiscences in which the characters of his own childhood and of his best-loved fiction, particularly Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer, come alive again. The autobiographical recollections culminate in an astounding feat of memory titled "Villagers of 1840-3" in which the author, writing for himself alone at the age of sixty-one, recalls with humor and pathos the characters of some one hundred and fifty people from his childhood. Accompanied by notes that reflect extensive new research on Mark Twain\'s early life in Missouri, the selections in this volume offer a revealing view of Mark Twain\'s varied and repeated attempts to give literary expression to the Matter of Hannibal.<br /><br />Texts established by Dahlia Armon, Paul Baender, Walter Blair, William M.

All will find something in the book about how others wish to be effectively communicated with. A Fit book for programmers wouldn\'t make sense because the goal is to create a language for business-oriented team members. A Fit book just for businesspeople wouldn\'t make sense because the programmers have to be involved in creating that language. The result is a book that should appeal to a wide range of people whose shared goal is improving team communications."<br /><br />--Kent Beck, Three Rivers Institute<br /><br />"Even with the best approaches, there always seemed to be a gap between the software that was written and the software the user wanted. With Fit we can finally close the loop. This is an important piece in the agile development puzzle."<br /><br />--Dave Thomas, coauthor of <i>The Pragmatic Programmer</i><br /><br />"Ward and Rick do a great job in eschewing the typical, overly complicated technology trap by presenting a simple, user-oriented, and very usable technology that holds fast to the agile principles needed for success in this new millennium."<br /><br />--Andy Hunt, coauthor of <i>The Pragmatic Programmer</i><br /><br />"Florida Tech requires software engineering students to take a course in programmer testing, which I teach. Mugridge and Cunningham have written a useful and instructive book, which will become one of our course texts."<br /><br />--Cem Kaner, Professor of Software Engineering, Florida Institute of Technology<br /><br />"Rick and Ward continue to amaze me. Testing business rules is a fundamentally hard thing that has confounded many, and yet these two have devised a mechanism that cuts to the essence of the problem. In this work they offer a simple, thorough, approachable, and automatable means of specifying and testing such rules."<br /><br />--Grady Booch, IBM Fellow<br /><br />"By providing a simple, effective method for creating and automating tabular examples of requirements, Fit has dramatically improved how domain experts, analysts, testers, and programmers collaborate to produce quality software."<br /><br />--Joshua Kerievsky, founder, Industrial Logic, Inc., and author of <i>Refactoring to Patterns </i><br /><br />"Agile software development relies on collaborating teams, teams of customers, analysts, designers, developers, testers, and technical writers. But, how do they work together? Fit is one answer, an answer that has been thoroughly thought through, implemented, and tested in a number of situations. Primavera has significantly stabilized its product lineusing Fit, and I\'m so impressed by the results that I\'m suggesting it to everyone I know. Rick and Ward, in their everlasting low-key approach, have again put the keystone in the arch of software development. Congratulations and thanks from the software development community."<br /><br />--Ken Schwaber, Scrum Alliance, Agile Alliance, and codeveloper of Scrum<br /><br />"Fit is the most important new technique for understanding and communicating requirements. It\'s a revolutionary approach to bringing experts and programmers together. This book describes Fit comprehensively and authoritatively. If you want to produce great software, you need to read this book."<br /><br />--James Shore, Principal, Titanium I.T. LLC<br /><br />"There are both noisy and quiet aspects of the agile movement and it is often the quieter ones that have great strategic importance. This book by Ward and Rick describes one of these absolutely vital, but often quieter, practices--testing business requirements. A renewed focus on testing, from test-driven development for developers to story testing for customers, is one of the agile community\'s great contributions to our industry, and this book will become one of the cornerstones of that contribution. Stories are done-done (ready for release) when they have been tested by both developers (done) and customers (done-done). The concepts and practices involved in customer story testing are critical to project success and wonderfully portrayed in this book. Buy it. Read it. Keep it handy in your day-to-day work."<br /><br />--Jim Highsmith, Director of Agile Software Development &amp; Project Management Practice, Cutter Consortium<br /><br />"I have been influenced by many books, but very few have fundamentally changed how I think and work. This is one of those books. The ideas in this book describe not just how to use a specific framework in order to test our software, but also how we should communicate about and document that software. This book is an excellent guide to a tool and approach that will fundamentally improve how you think about and build software--as it has done for me."<br /><br />--Mike Cohn, Mountain Goat Software, author of <i>User Stories Applied </i><br /><br />"Fit is a tool to help whole teams grow a common language for describing and testing the behavior of software. This books fills a critical gap--helping both product owners and programmers learn what Fit is and how to use it well."<br /><br />--Bill Wake, independent consultant<br /><br />"Over the past several years, I\'ve been using Fit and FitNesse with development teams. They are not only free and powerful testing tools, they transform development by making the behavior of applications concrete, verifiable, and easily observable. The only thing that has been missing is a good tutorial and reference. Rick Mugridge and Ward Cunningham\'s <b> <i>Fit For Developing Software</i> </b> fits the bill. Essentially, two books in one, it is a very readable guide that approaches Fit from technical and nontechnical perspectives. This book is a significant milestone and it will make higher software quality achievable for many teams."<br /><br />--Michael C. Feathers, author of <i>Working Effectively with Legacy Code</i>, and consultant, Object Mentor, Inc.<br /><br />"Wow! This is the book I wish I had on my desk when I did my first story test-driven development project. It explains the philosophy behind the Fit framework and a process for using it to interact with the customers to help define the requirements of the project. It makes Fit so easy and approachable that I wrote my first FitNesse tests before I even I finished the book.<br /><br />"For the price of one book, you get two, written by the acknowledged thought leaders of Fit testing. The first is written for the nonprogramming customer. It lays out how you can define the functionality of the system you are building (or modifying) using tabular data. It introduces a range of different kinds of \'test fixtures\' that interpret the data and exercise the system under test. While it is aimed at a nontechnical audience, even programmers will find it useful because it also describes the process for interacting with the customers, using the Fit tests as the focal point of the interaction.<br /><br />"The second \'book\' is targeted to programmers. It describes how to build each kind of fixture described in the first book. It also describes many other things that need to be considered to have robust automated tests--things like testing without a database to make tests run faster. A lot of the principles will be familiar to programmers who have used any member of the xUnit family of unit testing frameworks. Rick and Ward show you how to put it into practice in a very easy-to-read narrative style that uses a fictitious case study to lead you through all the practices and decisions you are likely to encounter."<br /><br />--Gerard Meszaros, ClearStream Consulting<br /><br />The Fit open source testing framework brings unprecedented agility to the entire development process. <b> <i>Fit for Developing Software</i> </b> shows you how to use Fit to clarify business rules, express them with concrete examples, and organize the examples into test tables that drive testing throughout the software lifecycle. Using a realistic case study, Rick Mugridge and Ward Cunningham--the creator of Fit--introduce each of Fit\'s underlying concepts and techniques, and explain how you can put Fit to work incrementally, with the lowest possible risk. Highlights include<br /><br /><br />Integrating Fit into your development processes Using Fit to promote effective communication between businesspeople, testers, and developers Expressing business rules that define calculations, decisions, and business processes Connecting Fit tables to the system with "fixtures" that check whether tests are actually satisfied Constructing tests for code evolution, restructuring, and other changes to legacy systems Managing the quality and evolution of tests A companion Web site (http: //<a target="_blank" href="http://fit.c2.com/" rel="nofollow">fit.c2.com/</a>) that offers additional resources and source code <br />'

p602
(lp603
S'<b>Updated Edition</b>: Thomas L. Friedman is not so much a futurist, which he is sometimes called, as a presentist. His aim in <i>The World Is Flat</i>, as in his earlier, influential <i>Lexus and the Olive Tree</i>, is not to give you a speculative preview of the wonders that are sure to come in your lifetime, but rather to get you caught up on the wonders that are already here. The world isn\'t going to be flat, it <i>is</i> flat, which gives Friedman\'s breathless narrative much of its urgency, and which also saves it from the Epcot-style polyester sheen that futurists--the optimistic ones at least--are inevitably prey to. <p> What Friedman means by "flat" is "connected": the lowering of trade and political barriers and the exponential technical advances of the digital revolution that have made it possible to do business, or almost anything else, instantaneously with billions of other people across the planet. This in itself should not be news to anyone. But the news that Friedman has to deliver is that just when we stopped paying attention to these developments--when the dot-com bust turned interest away from the business and technology pages and when 9/11 and the Iraq War turned all eyes toward the Middle East--is when they actually began to accelerate. Globalization 3.0, as he calls it, is driven not by major corporations or giant trade organizations like the World Bank, but by individuals: desktop freelancers and innovative startups all over the world (but especially in India and China) who can compete--and win--not just for low-wage manufacturing and information labor but, increasingly, for the highest-end research and design work as well. (He doesn\'t forget the "mutant supply chains" like Al-Qaeda that let the small act big in more destructive ways.) </p><p> Friedman has embraced this flat world in his own work, continuing to report on his story after his book\'s release and releasing an unprecedented hardcover update of the book a year later with 100 pages of revised and expanded material. What\'s changed in a year? Some of the sections that opened eyes in the first edition--on China and India, for example, and the global supply chain--are largely unaltered. Instead, Friedman has more to say about what he now calls "uploading," the direct-from-the-bottom creation of culture, knowledge, and innovation through blogging, podcasts, and open-source software. And in response to the pleas of many of his readers about how to survive the new flat world, he makes specific recommendations about the technical and creative training he thinks will be required to compete in the "New Middle" class. As before, Friedman tells his story with the catchy slogans and globe-hopping anecdotes that readers of his earlier books and his <i>New York Times</i> columns know well, and he holds to a stern sort of optimism. He wants to tell you how exciting this new world is, but he also wants you to know you\'re going to be trampled if you don\'t keep up with it. A year later, one can sense his rising impatience that our popular culture, and our political leaders, are not helping us keep pace. <i>--Tom Nissley</i></p>'

p626
(lp627
S'Dr. White has done it again! From the author of our tremendously popular The Mouth of the Lion (the life of heroic Bishop Antonio de Castro Mayer) comes this new - and different - biography of Archbishop Lefebvre.<br /><br />Make no mistake, this biography is unlike ANY you have read before. It is a mosaic, if you will, providing parenthetical glimpses and historical soundbites of the life of Marcel Lefebvre. Each tid-bit (sometimes one to a page, sometimes five to a page) offers a new and fascinating insight.<br /><br />A truly unique style of writing. It is perfectly suited to those who want the convenience of picking up the book and reading for one minute OR one hour. Pick it up. Put it down. On your time.<br /><br />Although not a definitive and exhaustive biography like Bishop Tissier de Mallerais\'s Marcel Lefebvre, The Horn of the Unicorn deftly weaves poetry, Scripture, anecdotes, news, and history into the story of the life of Archbishop Lefebvre.<br /><br />The result is an inspiring and thought-provoking appreciation of his life from one of America\'s most distinguished Catholic writers. But, you\'re asking, "I read Bishop Tissier\'s bio. Why should I read this one?" Because it invites the reader to reflect on the life of Archbishop Lefebvre in a new and different way. Like a motion picture on paper, Dr. White associates thoughts, images, notions, quotations in such a way that an understanding of the Archbishop and his times emerges.<br /><br />The crisis in the Church is not fun. None of us wants the current situation we are in, but God has His reasons... "to them that love God, all things work together unto good" (Rom. 8:28). One of these reasons is summed up in the Latin phrase "Crescit sub pondere Virtus" (virtue grows out of adversity). We have the opportunity to "step up to the plate" ourselves AND the privilege of living among saints. How many of us met this great man? Were confirmed by him? Received the Body of Christ from his hands? Received his blessing? How fortunate we are!<br /><br />Dr. White says, "But allow me to share a comment made to me once by the late Fr. Malachi Martin, \'Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre and Bishop Antonio de Castro Mayer are the two great saints of the modern Church. Once this catastrophe ends they will be instantly canonized.\'"'

S'Dutch-American painter Willem de Kooning was a first generation Abstract Expressionist. Starting as an "angry young man" in the 1930s, he is best known for his Women series-a subject he pursued from the beginning to the end of his career. In the 1970s he began to make sculptures.<br />At a ripe old age, de Kooning\'s furor made way for a quiet, almost conceptual art of painting that is nevertheless full of suspense. Heading in a new direction, his works became more drawing-like, with a preference for primary colors, eventually including pastel colors to the palette. Bridging the gap to Minimalism, he never abandoned gestural forms.<br />This volume is the first to focus on Willem de Kooning\'s late paintings, with essays by Julie Sylvester and David Sylvester. It accompanies a travelling exhibition starting at the Hermitage Museum St. Petersburg in summer 2006 and presenting 24 works, most of which have never been seen before.<p></p>'

Among them is a knight, a monk, a prioress, a plowman, a miller, a merchant, a clerk, and an oft-widowed wife from Bath. Travel is arduous and wearing; to maintain their spirits, this band of pilgrims entertains each other with a series of tall tales that span the spectrum of literary genres. Five hundred years later, people are still reading Geoffrey Chaucer\'s <i>Canterbury Tales</i>. If you haven\'t yet made the acquaintance of the Franklin, the Pardoner, or the Squire because you never learned Middle English, take heart: this edition of the <i>Tales</i> has been translated into modern idiom. <p> From the heroic romance of "The Knight\'s Tale" to the low farce embodied in the stories of the Miller, the Reeve, and the Merchant, Chaucer treated such universal subjects as love, sex, and death in poetry that is simultaneously witty, insightful, and poignant. <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> is a grand tour of 14th-century English mores and morals--one that modern-day readers will enjoy.</p>'

S'In Sam Shepard\'s play Action a character asks, "What\'s a community?" only to find that no one really knows. Rooms with a View attempts to chart the development of communal concepts through the discourse of dramatic modernism, defining a coherent pattern that illustrates and anticipates innovations in modern and postmodern social theory. To clarify the commonplace notion that audiences actively participate in dramatic art, the intro-ductory chapter theorizes a <i>performance community</i>, which audience, actors, and other backstage actants (such as playwrights and directors) provisionally form in the theater. Connecting psychological, sociological, and aesthetic insights ranging from Freud to Kohut, from Simmel to Nancy, and from Artaud and Brecht to Arnheim and Jellicoe, Richard Barr shows how modernist thinkers are repeatedly drawn to the ideal of communion. The distinctive structure of this collective inquiry helps untangle the roots and routes of modern drama and social thought.<br /><br />Barr analyzes the social and aesthetic theory of four in-fluential dramatists. Ibsen and Strindberg, he claims, explore ways of acknowledging the integrity of individual viewpoints while maintaining collective coherence. Pirandello and, in more radical ways, Beckett, conclude that conflict and division are not simply inevitable but invaluable in organizing alternative perspectives. By analyzing the ways playwrights variously conceive and achieve the complicated unity called community, <i>Rooms with a View</i> produces the rich paradox that difference may make the most difference in creative communal consensus.<br /><br />Richard L. Barr holds a Ph.D. from the University of Virginia, and has taught English at Rutgers University. He is currently a specialist in intersubjective relations, practicing in New Jersey and Switzerland.<br />'

S'Software platforms are the invisible engines that have created, touched, or transformed nearly every major industry for the past quarter century. They power everything from mobile phones and automobile navigation systems to search engines and web portals. They have been the source of enormous value to consumers and helped some entrepreneurs build great fortunes. And they are likely to drive change that will dwarf the business and technology revolution we have seen to this point. <i>Invisible Engines</i> examines the business dynamics and strategies used by firms that recognize the transformative power unleashed by this new revolution -- a revolution that will change both new and old industries.<br /><br />The authors argue that in order to understand the successes of software platforms, we must first understand their role as a technological meeting ground where application developers and end users converge. Apple, Microsoft, and Google, for example, charge developers little or nothing for using their platforms and make most of their money from end users; Sony PlayStation and other game consoles, by contrast, subsidize users and make more money from developers, who pay royalties for access to the code they need to write games. More applications attract more users, and more users attract more applications. And more applications and more users lead to more profits.<br /><br /><i>Invisible Engines</i> explores this story through the lens of the companies that have mastered this platform-balancing act. It offers detailed studies of the personal computer, video game console, personal digital assistant, smart mobile phone, and digital media software platform industries, focusing on the business decisions made by industry players to drive profits and stay a step ahead of the competition. Shorter discussions of Internet-based software platforms provide an important glimpse into a future in which the way we buy, pay, watch, listen, learn, and communicate will change forever.

This collection includes interviews in which Malamud gives a commentary on each of his novels and on many of his short stories. What emerges from these encounters with this great author is a sense of Malamud's deep, lifetime commitment to his art and to a seriousness of purpose.<br /><br />Though there is very little domestic detail or literary gossip in Malamud's conversations, these interviews reveal the essence of a great writer that the multitudes of readers inspired by his books crave to find and retain."

Georgia did become ?Georgia of the Jungle!? in this book full of examples of how an all-knowing God can orchestrate a person's life to fulfill the purpose for which it was created. In this instance, it was the life of author, Georgia Egge. Many illustrations of seeing God work first-hand fill the pages with the supernatural intervention of a God who is never late. The reader will come to understand that God will use anyone willing to step out in His calling. His divine protection and direction is demonstrated in many of the experiences that Georgia went through to reach remote places with the Gospel. She shares many character-shaping lessons learned through surrendering to the Holy Spirit and yielding her will to the Father?s. Leaving all behind to do the work of the ministry, she endures hardship like a good soldier and sees the glory of God revealed. ?George of the Jungle: is a must-read for those who love mission work, those considering ministry, or any believer, or (non-believer), who wants a true?life glimpse of the miraculous power of love at work in the most challenging of settings and circumstances."

Explorer and writer Tim Severin travelled to the islands of the Pacific to find out. From Nuku Hiva in the Marquesas archipelago to Pamilacan and Tonga, Severin compares myth with reality in a fascinating journey of discovery. Along the way he investigates the real extent of Melville's whaling experience, and unearths other potential sources for his famous story; encounters the extraordinary whale-jumpers, who even now make their living by leaping on the backs of whales to ram home their spears; and observes a retired harpooner re-enact the curious ballet of a kill - transporting himself to his youth in the process, like a shaman from a forgotten age. Travel writing and personal and historical anecdote combine to offer an exploration of one of the ocean's enduring myths."

The horrific brutality which both women and children undergo evokes a response of unparalleled intensity in the playwright whom Aristotle called the most tragic of the poets. Yet the new battle-ground of the aftermath of war is one in which the women of Troy evince an overwhelming greatness of spirit. We weep for the aged Hecuba in her name play and in the Trojan Women, yet we respond with an at times appalled admiration to her resilience amid unrelieved suffering. And in her name play Andromache, the slave-concubine of her husband's killer, endures her existence in the victor's country with a Stoic nobility. Of their time yet timeless, these plays insist on the victory of the female spirit amid the horrors visited on them by the gods and men during war."

S'This fourth volume in the Library of America edition of the complete novels of Henry James contains the four novels he wrote after a failed attempt to forge a career as a playwright on the London stage. Together they mark the beginning of the brilliant period in the novelist\'s career known as the late phase. <br /> "The Other House" (1896) shows James incorporating an act of murder into the heart of his narrative. Long neglected, the novel is a fascinating glimpse into a very different side of Henry James, as he explores the violent implications of jealousy and possessiveness. In "The Spoils of Poynton" (1897), the artworks conserved in the manor house of the title become the object of a protracted power struggle between the mother and the fianc?e of the heir to the house. The struggle, in this most tightly constructed of James\'s late novels, hinges ultimately on the sensitivities of a third woman. <br /> "What Maisie Knew" (1897) recounts the aftermath of a divorce through the eyes of the couple\'s daughter. James adopts what he described as "the consciousness, the dim, sweet, scared, wondering, clinging perception of the child." Similarly experimental, "The Awkward Age" (1899) maps the interrelations of a large cast of characters, a group of old friends and their children, almost entirely through dialogue. The ambiguity of childhood innocence is central to both of these novels.'

Inside the pages of this cookbook are recipes for Mary's favorite foods, in and out of the garden, from porridge to roasted potatoes and eggs, all inspired by The Secret Garden and all adapted by chef and culinary historian Amy Cotler from traditional Victorian recipes. Ms. Cotler has supplemented these simple, wholesome recipes with fascinating tidbits on Victorian foods and Victorian eating customs.

S'When the whole is greater than the sum of the parts--indeed, so great that the sum far transcends the parts and represents something utterly new and different--we call that phenomenon emergence. When the chemicals diffusing in the primordial waters came together to form the first living cell, that was emergence. When the activities of the neurons in the brain result in mind, that too is emergence.<br /> In The Emergence of Everything, one of the leading scientists involved in the study of complexity, Harold J. Morowitz, takes us on a sweeping tour of the universe, a tour with 28 stops, each one highlighting a particularly important moment of emergence. For instance, Morowitz illuminates the emergence of the stars, the birth of the elements and of the periodic table, and the appearance of solar systems and planets. We look at the emergence of living cells, animals, vertebrates, reptiles, and mammals, leading to the great apes and the appearance of humanity. He also examines tool making, the evolution of language, the invention of agriculture and technology, and the birth of cities. And as he offers these insights into the evolutionary unfolding of our universe, our solar system, and life itself, Morowitz also seeks out the nature of God in the emergent universe, the God posited by Spinoza, Bruno, and Einstein, a God Morowitz argues we can know through a study of the laws of nature. <br /> Written by one of our wisest scientists, The Emergence of Everything offers a fascinating new way to look at the universe and the natural world, and it makes an important contribution to the dialogue between science and religion.<br />'

p910
(lp911
S'This one-volume omnibus, planned by the author before his death and now completed by his biographer, Ann Charters, makes clear the ambition and accomplishment of Jack Kerouac\'s "Legend of Duluoz" - the story of his life told in the course of his many "true-story novels, " including "On the Road." As Kerouac once wrote, "The whole thing forms on enormous comedy, seen through the eyes of poor Ti Jean (me), otherwise known as Jack Duluoz, the world of raging action and folly and also of gentle sweetness seen through the keyhole of his eye." The only anthology of Kerouac\'s work ever published, this compilation presents selections from the "Legend of Duluoz" novels, in chronological order, and also includes poetry, letters, and essays on Buddhism, writing, and the Beat Generation. "The Portable Jack Kerouac" is an essential introduction to one of this country\'s most important modern writers.'

We have all admired the natural grace of old buildings and wondered why modern architects seem to have such a hard time creating their equal. We live in a time when only a few gifted and dedicated teams of designers can produce buildings that approach the beauty of these that eighteenth-century carpenters created all by themselves. What went wrong? In this fascinating tour of our buildings and our social history, Jonathan Hale examines the historical moment in the 1830s when builders and architects began to lose their sense of surety about what they were doing. He explores the societal pressures that turned buildings from pure efforts at expression into structures laden with symbols. Most important, he uncovers - in terms the lay reader can easily understand - the principles that animate great architecture, no matter what its style or period. In The'

The sole tenant in a rundown tenement, Henry Lesser is struggling to finish a novel, but his solitary pursuit of the sublime grows complicated when Willie Spearmint, a black writer ambivalent toward Jews, moves into the building. Henry and Willie are artistic rivals and unwilling neighbors, and their uneasy peace is disturbed by the presence of Willie's white girlfriend Irene and the landlord Levenspiel's attempts to evict both men and demolish the building. This novel's conflict, current then, is perennial now; it reveals the slippery nature of the human condition, and the human capacity for violence and undoing."

So why the upwelling of nameless dread? Why the regret after cocktail parties and the road rage and, worst of all, the certainty that he is somehow a stranger to himself? Harper has always seen transformative love as the heart\'s salvation; but he\'s found his elusive ideal only twice, with miserable consequences. "A Mouth Like Yours" tells of a third and grand collision, with the vulnerable, volatile, and addictive Joanie Artois. <br />So quickly does Harper lose himself in Joanie, so thoroughly does she colonize his heart, that he sets out to understand why, exactly, love always unmans him this way. Exploring what carnal love can do for us and what it cannot, "A Mouth Like Yours" is a poignant statement about the growing pains of a generation.<br />'

Julian Markel takes as his point of departure the scholarly tradition that sees in <i>King Lear</i> a dramatization of the transition from feudal to bourgeois culture. He shows how Melville takes up the "ideological unfinished business" of Shakespeare\'s play to dramatize in <i>Moby Dick</i> a distinctive American tension between private and competition and mutual responsibility within bourgeois individualism. Tracing the ideological conflicts encompassed by <i>Moby Dick</i> to their analogs in the theories of Hooker, Hobbes, and Locke, Markels argues that Melville\'s novel "articulates the unique aspirations and underlying fears of American culture at a commanding moment of national self-awareness."<br /><p> Markel\'s work will be of interest to students of intellectual history, American studies, and philosophical anthropology as well as literary critics.</p>'

p1066
(lp1067
S'Anyone who has wondered if free will is just an illusion or has asked \'could I have chosen otherwise?\' after performing some rash deed will find this book an absorbing discussion of an endlessly fascinating subject. Daniel Dennett, whose previous books include "Brainstorms "and (with Douglas Hofstadter) "The Mind\'s I, " tackles the free will problem in a highly original and witty manner, drawing on the theories and concepts of several fields usually ignored by philosophers; not just physics and evolutionary biology, but engineering, automata theory, and artificial intelligence.<br /><br />In "Elbow Room," Dennett shows how the classical formulations of the problem in philosophy depend on misuses of imagination, and he disentangles the philosophical problems of real interest from the "family of anxieties\' they get enmeshed in - imaginary agents, bogeymen, and dire prospects that seem to threaten our freedom. Putting sociobiology in its rightful place, he concludes that we can have free will and science too. "Elbow Room" begins by showing how we can be "moved by reasons" without being exempt from physical causation. It goes on to analyze concepts of control and self-control-concepts often skimped by philosophers but which are central to the questions of free will and determinism. A chapter on "self-made selves" discusses the idea of self or agent to see how it can be kept from disappearing under the onslaught of science. Dennett then sees what can be made of the notion of acting under the idea of freedomdoes the elbow room we think we have really exist? What is an opportunity, and how can anything in our futures be "up to us"? He investigates the meaning of "can" and "could have done otherwise," and asks why we want free will in the first place.We are wise, Dennett notes, to want free will, but that in itself raises a host of questions about responsibility. In a final chapter, he takes up the problem of how anyone can ever be guilty, and what the rationale is for holding people responsible and even, on occasion, punishing them.<br /><br />"Elbow Room "is an expanded version of the John Locke Lectures which Dennett gave at Oxford University in 1983.'

While the Knights concerns the perfect democratic ruler, the Assemblywomen is about the perfect democratic law. The first close reading of these works and exploration of the connection between them, Aristophanes' Male and Female Revolutions not only illuminates these two plays, but also offers insight into questions at the core of political life.

S"Willem de Kooning is celebrated in the United States as one of the most significant artists of the twentieth century and a leading Abstract Expressionist. In Europe, however, the artist has yet to be fully recognized, particularly with regards to his work of the 1960s and 1970s, when he retreated from urban life to live and work on Long Island. This segment of de Kooning's oeuvre bears the imprint of a fundamental experience of the landscape, for it was in these Long Island works that he developed a new style of figuration, characterized by a transformed sense of color and energetic gesture. This period of vigorous, pioneering creativity is illuminated for the first time in this volume, which features a concentrated selection of large-format paintings. In images and essays by Klaus Kertess, Harold Rosenberg and others, the book illustrates how de Kooning's paintings--although recognizable as landscapes--grew abstract under the influence of his intense experience of nature."

But was he right? Can the quantum theory of fields and Einstein\'s general theory of relativity, the two most accurate and successful theories in all of physics, be united in a single quantum theory of gravity? Can quantum and cosmos ever be combined? On this issue, two of the world\'s most famous physicists--Stephen Hawking ("A Brief History of Time") and Roger Penrose ("The Emperor\'s New Mind" and "Shadows of the Mind")--disagree. Here they explain their positions in a work based on six lectures with a final debate, all originally presented at the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences at the University of Cambridge.<br /><br />How could quantum gravity, a theory that could explain the earlier moments of the big bang and the physics of the enigmatic objects known as black holes, be constructed? Why does our patch of the universe look just as Einstein predicted, with no hint of quantum effects in sight? What strange quantum processes can cause black holes to evaporate, and what happens to all the information that they swallow? Why does time go forward, not backward?<br /><br />In this book, the two opponents touch on all these questions. Penrose, like Einstein, refuses to believe that quantum mechanics is a final theory. Hawking thinks otherwise, and argues that general relativity simply cannot account for how the universe began. Only a quantum theory of gravity, coupled with the no-boundary hypothesis, can ever hope to explain adequately what little we can observe about our universe. Penrose, playing the realist to Hawking\'s positivist, thinks that the universe is unbounded and will expand forever. The universe can be understood, he argues, in terms of the geometry of light cones, the compression and distortion of spacetime, and by the use of twistor theory. With the final debate, the reader will come to realize how much Hawking and Penrose diverge in their opinions of the ultimate quest to combine quantum mechanics and relativity, and how differently they have tried to comprehend the incomprehensible.'

S"Hugely successful in her own time for adult novels and plays, Frances Hodgson Burnett (1849-1924) would be astounded to find out she is remembered for a handful of books for children, but most of all for the enormously popular <i>Secret Garden</i>. This fascinating biography-the first to have the full cooperation of Burnett's descendants and relatives-examines her life with lively intelligence, sensitivity, and fascinating new, never-before-published material.<br /><br />Burnett's life was full of those reversals of fortune that mark her work. Following modest beginnings in mid-Victorian Manchester, she arrived in post-Civil War Tennessee at the age of fifteen with her widowed mother and two sisters. Burnett was the breadwinner of the family from the age of seventeen, eventually publishing a total of fifty-two books and writing and producing thirteen plays. She made and spent a fortune in her lifetime, was generous and profligate, yet anxious about money and obsessively hardworking.<br /><br />Constantly restless and inventive, Burnett's personal life was as complex as her professional one. Her first marriage to a southern doctor disintegrated as a result of her notorious flirtations and a scandalous affair, and her subsequent marriage to an English doctor turned actor suffered a similar fate. She understood the intensity and loneliness of the thoughtful child, but was herself a largely absent mother of two sons-overwhelmed by guilt when tragedy struck one of them; the other one never got over being the model for Little Lord Fauntleroy.<br /><br />A woman of contrasts and paradoxes, this quintessentially British writer was equally at home in the United States, which honored her with a memorial in Central Park. Frances Hodgson Burnett reinvented for herself and for generations to come in both countries the magic and the mystery of the childhood she never had."

Pip must discover his true self, and his own set of values and priorities. Whether such values allow one to prosper in the complex world of early Victorian England is the major question posed by Great Expectations, one of Dickens's most fascinating, and disturbing, novels. This edition includes the original, discarded ending, Dickens's brief working notes, and the serial instalments and chapter divisions in different editions.

S"Erasmus of Rotterdam (c. 1466-1536) is one of the greatest figures of the Renaissance humanist movement, which abandoned medieval pieties in favour of a rich new vision of the individual's potential. Praise of Folly, written to amuse his friend Sir Thomas More, is Erasmus's best-known work. Its dazzling mixture of fantasy and satire is narrated by a personification of Folly, dressed as a jester, who celebrates youth, pleasure, drunkenness and sexual desire, and goes on to lambast human pretensions, foibles and frailties, to mock theologians and monks and to praise the folly' of simple Christian piety. Erasmus's wit, wordplay and wisdom made the book an instant success, but it also attracted what may have been sales-boosting criticism. The Letter to Maarten van Dorp, which is a defence of his ideas and methods, is also included."

Instead they see biblical stories with all their rough edges - the unethical and ambiguous characters, the unsolved problems, and the surprising endings. Adams's book shows how seeing these faults in biblical figures and events strengthens modern Christians' faith. In addition to pointing out cleverness in the Bible.

S'One of the most salient features of our culture is that there is so much bullshit. Everyone knows this. Each of us contributes his share. But we tend to take the situation for granted. Most people are rather confident of their ability to recognize bullshit and to avoid being taken in by it. So the phenomenon has not aroused much deliberate concern. We have no clear understanding of what bullshit is, why there is so much of it, or what functions it serves. And we lack a conscientiously developed appreciation of what it means to us. In other words, as Harry Frankfurt writes, "we have no theory." Frankfurt, one of the world\'s most influential moral philosophers, attempts to build such a theory here. With his characteristic combination of philosophical acuity, psychological insight, and wry humor, Frankfurt proceeds by exploring how bullshit and the related concept of humbug are distinct from lying. He argues that bullshitters misrepresent themselves to their audience not as liars do, that is, by deliberately making false claims about what is true. In fact, bullshit need not be untrue at all.<br /><br />Rather, bullshitters seek to convey a certain impression of themselves without being concerned about whether anything at all is true. They quietly change the rules governing their end of the conversation so that claims about truth and falsity are irrelevant. Frankfurt concludes that although bullshit can take many innocent forms, excessive indulgence in it can eventually undermine the practitioner\'s capacity to tell the truth in a way that lying does not. Liars at least acknowledge that it matters what is true. By virtue of this, Frankfurt writes, bullshit is a greater enemy of the truth thanlies are.'

S'Remembrance of Things Past<br />"I find myself wanting to translate the world inside..."<br /><br />Sagesse LaBasse, the teenage protagonist of Claire Messud\'s <i>The Last Life</i>, lives in a fragile world held together by the secrets of its past. Her family owns the Hotel Bellevue, a summer retreat for the well-to-do, set on the cliffs of southern France; the view is back toward Algeria, which her paternal grandparents fled during its struggle for independence from France. As her grandmother laments, "Every morning, I wake up and look out my window at the Mediterranean sea, vast and creeping, and I smell the pines and the heat on the breeze, rising up the clifftop, and I\'m in Algiers again. I live, still, in my heart, in Algeria." <br /><br />The loss of their homeland is always present to the LaBasses, and the consequent search for identity both reflects and compounds other difficulties. Sagesse\'s father ("fleshy, ingratiating, explosive") languishes under his own father\'s control, and is often unfaithful to Sagesse\'s mother, an American who tries to pass as French. Meanwhile, their young son, Etienne, is so severely mentally and physically impaired that his birth is likened to "the clanging of their prison door." Sagesse\'s grandmother looks on with cool resignation, and her grandfather, the family\'s hot-headed patriarch, will let no one rest. When, late one night, the old man fires his rifle into a group of children swimming at the hotel\'s pool, no one is seriously injured, but the family\'s livelihood is put at risk, and long-simmering resentments find an outlet.<br /><br />Sagesse is the perfect narrator for this fractured situation. She is neither French, nor American; not a girl, yet not quite a woman. Her grandfather\'s rash act causes her to lose her friends at school, and she is forced to "seek out the very pot-smokers I had...readily disparaged little over a month before." These new friends, upon realizing her family\'s past (having been French colonists, they are suspected of being racists, and members of the National Front) and relative wealth, also abandon her. With guests trickling away from the hotel, and tensions rising within the LaBasse family, Sagesse tries to understand what remains, and what place there might be for her. <br /><br />Fortunately, while her life may be painful, she never finds it dull. Sagesse\'s language is rich and evocative, full of descriptive power. Here, for example, she witnesses the market: "There were vegetable men and fruit women and stalls selling both, blushing mounds of peaches alongside plump and purple eggplants...pale, splayed organs of fennel pressing their ridged tubes and feathered ends up against the sugar-speckled, wrinkled carcasses of North African dates...the fishmongers sold their bullet-eyed, silver-skinned, slippery catch, blood-streaked fillets and orbed, scored steaks, milky scallops and encrusted oysters...." And here, a painting of the Bay of Algiers: "its apron of azure sea, erratically white-capped, broken by the sandstone finger of the port...the white rise of the city, a thousand precise terraces and roofs climbing into the sunlit sky, the European curlicues and the higgledy-piggledy casbah, all their outlines drawn as if with a single hair, interspersed with delicate little palms and cypresses and other trees of variegated greens, and with broad, brown avenues like branches."<br /><br />A brilliant, complex world is formed by the accretion of these images, and they are juxtaposed and spur each other seamlessly, multiplying atmosphere and complicating plot lines. While most of the novel\'s events take place around 1990, Sagesse tells of them from a time almost a decade later (when she is a graduate student of the "history of ideas" at Columbia). This frame, constructed of occasional asides and short passages, allows a fluidity where revelations from the past and future cause momentum to shift and whirl -- the dead rise, their movements sharper and words more portentous with the reader\'s knowledge of coming tragedy. This later perspective also enables Sagesse to add deft hints and wise commentary. Looking back on herself, for instance, she says, "Children do not have words to ask and so do not imagine asking; not asking and not imagining, they eradicate distance: they take for granted that everything, someday, will be understood."<br /><br /><i>The Last Life</i> stands as a testament to reflection, to making sense of an unruly past. It is also a kind of autobiography, an attempt to constitute an identity. In its ebb and flow of images, action, and ideas, the narrative deals so well with this attempt, implicitly, that it\'s unfortunate that it must also be treated explicitly. Frequent asides concerning identity and the nature of the self ("the one thing that would not leave me: the only and inadequate definition of my \'I.\'") seem unnecessary; they lure Sagesse into self-dramatization, and contain the novel\'s most uneven prose. Some readers may find that such self-analysis helps characterize the narrator, but it\'s difficult to believe the story wouldn\'t be stronger without it. <br /><br />Still, the novel\'s concern with such weighty questions is representative of its, and Sagesse\'s, fearlessness. As she seeks the truth about her family and herself, she also reflects on politics and race, dreaming of a "Mediterranean culture democratic and polyphonous" while simultaneously acknowledging its impossibility. This seeming contradiction must be borne, she learns, since to blindly accept what has happened is to forget alternatives and to repeat mistakes. "I live as if this might-have-been existed," she writes, "shimmering in the imaginary; and if it is but an \'as if,\' I have learned, then it is none the less real for that."<br /><br /><i>The Last Life</i> ultimately concerns itself with questions of fate and self-determination. In a world of disasters, Sagesse wonders if and how they might have been avoided: "The abiding question...was it fate? Is our ending inscribed in our beginning -- and, if so, in whose beginning?" The "obvious answer," she says, is that we cannot escape our fate, that our choices are illusory. The richness found in her story, however, suggests the less obvious answer -- that we might affect our fate, and better confront the present and future, if we work to come to an understanding with our past.'

The colorful mailer, however, described something very different: a tour to some of the most exotic places on Earth. Slowly, an idea took hold in Nicholas's mind and heart. In January 2003, Nicholas Sparks and his brother, Micah, set off on a three-week trip around the globe. It was to mark a milestone in their lives, for at thirty-seven and thirty-eight respectively, they were now the only surviving members of their family. And as they voyaged to the lost city of Machu Picchu high in the Andes. . . to mysterious Easter Island. . . to Ayers Rock in the Australian outback. . . and across the vast Indian subcontinent, the ultimate story of their lives would unfold. Against the backdrop of the wonders of the world and often overtaken by their feelings, daredevil Micah and the more serious, introspective Nicholas recalled their rambunctious childhood adventures and the tragedies that tested their faith. And in the process, they discovered startling truths about loss, love and hope. Narrated with irrepressible humor and rare candor, and including personal photographs, Three Weeks with my Brother reminds us to embrace life with all its uncertainties. . . and most of all, to cherish the joyful times, both small and momentous, and the wonderful people who make them possible.<br /><br /><i>Did You Know?---<br /><br />Three Weeks With My Brother is Nicholas's second work of non-fiction?

Sturges demonstrates that various forms of erotic deviance have been differently valued in these different periods and cultures, and that dialogue has consistently proven to be the genre of choice for expressing these changing values.

S"James L.Kelley, a skeptic about religion, writes with insight and humor of his journey through St. Mark's, an Episcopal church that welcomes doubters without pressuring them to compromise their intellectual integrity. When Kelley first visited the church well into his forties, he was searching for a respite from urban malaise and found himself filled with disquieting questions: How could he reconcile his convictions with the central purpose of the church-to worship a God he didn't believe in? Could he say the prayers and sing the hymns while remaining an honest skeptic?<br /><br />After fifteen years of full participation in a church that is open not only to skeptics but also to gay men and lesbians, blacks and Jews, where members are invited to critique Sunday sermons, and where hymns are rewritten to reflect feminist concerns, Kelley found that his agnosticism remained but his skepticism about church participation had disappeared. Modern urban life can be a sterile, isolating experience. Yet in St. Mark's Kelley discovered a place of vibrant community, honest inquiry, and support over the hard places in life."

Pollack challenges conventional expectations about manhood and masculinity that encourage parents to treat boys as little men, raising them through a toughening process that drives their true emotions underground. Only when we understand what boys are really like, says Pollack, can we help them develop more self-confidence and the emotional savvy they need to deal with issues such as depression, love and sexuality, drugs and alcohol, divorce, and violence.<br /></div>"

S"Rebecca Krug argues that in the later Middle Ages, people defined themselves in terms of family relationships but increasingly saw their social circumstances as being connected to the written word. Complex family dynamics and social configurations motivated women to engage in text-based activities. Although not all or even the majority of women could read and write, it became natural for women to think of writing as a part of everyday life.Reading Families looks at the literate practice of two individual women, Margaret Paston and Margaret Beaufort, and of two communities in which women were central, the Norwich Lollards and the Bridgettines at Syon Abbey. The book begins with Paston's letters, which were written at her husband's request, and ends with devotional texts that describe the spiritual daughterhood of the Bridgettine readers.Scholars often assume that medieval women's participation in literate culture constituted a rejection of patriarchal authority. Krug maintains, however, that for most women learning to engage with the written word served as a practical response to social changes and was not necessarily a revolutionary act."

When he receives a letter from the tiny town of Boone Creek, North Carolina, about ghostly lights that appear in a legend-shrouded cemetery, he can\'t resist driving down to investigate. Here, in this tightly knit community, Lexie Darnell runs the town\'s library, just as her mother did before the accident that left Lexie an orphan. Disappointed by past relationships, including one that lured her away from home, she is sure of one thing: her future is in Boone Creek, close to her grandmother and all the other people she loves. Jeremy expects to spend a quick week in "the sticks" before speeding back to the city. But from the moment he sets eyes on Lexie, he is intrigued and attracted to this beautiful woman who speaks with a soft drawl and confounding honesty. And Lexie, while hesitating to trust this outsider, finds herself thinking of Jeremy more than she cares to admit. Now, if they are to be together, Jeremy Marsh must make a difficult choice: return to the life he knows, or do something he\'s never done before--take a giant leap of faith.

One immediately acquires a sense of the limitations and strengths of the anthropologist's role in the field. Heider's 1995 visit to the Dugnm Dani left him less optimistic about the future of the Dani than his 1988 visit. Indonesian Independence Day was celebrated during Heider's stay. The Dani presence was barely acknowledged, while the Indonesian presence was colorfully represented.

Here is the first cookbook to include recipes featuring Carbohydrate Choices--the new, simplified approach to meal planning recommended by the American Diabetes Association. For people who find diet exchanges too hard, too limiting or too much work, this new method is a real breakthrough.

From Old-Time Beef and Vegetable Stew to Creamy Vanilla-Caramel Cheesecake, the recipes are made with everyday ingredients, including sugar. No food groups or ingredients are left out, so there's no need for anyone to feel deprived or restricted to a special diet. Food exchanges are also included, making it easy for those who still count calories. Betty Crocker's Diabetes Cookbook is also packed with expert medical and nutrition tips from Dr. Richard Bergenstal, an endocrinologist and diabetes doctor, and two registered nurses-- invaluable for the newly diagnosed as well as for those who have been coping with diabetes for years. Throughout the book, real-life advice from people who have diabetes offers inspiration and great ideas on dealing with this chronic disease.

When Doone at the age of eight carries Crystal\'s shoes to her class and first hears, sees, and accidentally participates in dance, he is struck as if by a sorcerer\'s spell. But far from encouraging him, his parents are appalled -- his mother because Crystal is all, and his father, of course, because ballet is "sissy."

But the real threat to their survival isn't the ever-shifting landscape of white, the provisions that have turned to poison before they open them, or the ship slowly buckling in the grip of the frozen ocean. <br /><br />The real threat is whatever is out in the frigid darkness, stalking their ship, snatching one seaman at a time or whole crews, leaving bodies mangled horribly or missing forever. Captain Crozier takes over the expedition after the creature kills its original leader, Sir John Franklin. <br /><br />Drawing equally on his own strengths as a seaman and the mystical beliefs of the Eskimo woman he's rescued, Crozier sets a course on foot out of the Arctic and away from the insatiable beast. But every day the dwindling crew becomes more deranged and mutinous, until Crozier begins to fear there is no escape from an ever-more-inconceivable nightmare."

On the surface, it is a story of one man, Howard Roark, and his struggles as an architect in the face of a successful rival, Peter Keating, and a newspaper columnist, Ellsworth Toohey. But the book addresses a number of universal themes: the strength of the individual, the tug between good and evil, the threat of fascism.

Rarely, too, are the visual and spatial aspects of these plays given careful consideration. In this detailed and innovative book, Lowell Edmunds combines two readings of the Oedipus at Colonus to arrive at a new way of looking at Greek tragedy. Edmunds sets forth a semiotic theory of theatrical space, and then applies this theory to the visual and spatial dimensions of the Oedipus at Colonus. In his historical analysis, Edmunds describes the Athenian revolution of 411 B.C.E. and its effect on Colonus. The book includes an appendix on the life of Sophocles and the reception of the Oedipus at Colonus. Edmunds' unique approach to the Oedipus at Colonus. makes this an important book for students and scholars of semiotics, Greek tragedy, and theatrical performance."

S'A key figure in the development of Western literature, the Greek poet Theocritus of Syracuse, was the inventor of "bucolic" or pastoral poetry in the first half of the third century BC. These vignettes of country life, which center on competitions of song and love are the foundational poems of the western pastoral tradition. They were the principal model for Virgil in the Eclogues and their influence can be seen in the work of Petrarch and Milton. Although it is the pastoral poems for which he is chiefly famous, Theocritus also wrote hymns to the gods, brilliant mime depictions of everyday life, short narrative epics, epigrams, and encomia of the powerful. The great variety of his poems illustrates the rich and flourishing poetic culture of what was a golden age of Greek poetry.<br /> Based on the original Greek text, this accurate and fluent translation is the only edition of the complete Idylls currently in print. It includes an accessible introduction by Richard Hunter that describes what is known of Theocritus, the poetic tradition and Theocritus\' innovations and what exactly is meant by "bucolic" poetry.'

S'A biography of Rumer Godden. Born in India, at the height of British colonial power, she lived there until the 1950s. Her career as a novelist began with "Black Narcissus", which became a bestseller on publication in 1939 - and like many of her novels - was adapted into a film. Her relationship with India, although passionate, was ultimately and perhaps inevitably ambivalent and this ambivalence came to a head in an incident when she and her children were living in Kashmir. A servant tried to poison them and the notoriety surrounding the case forced Godden to leave Kashmir and eventually India itself. Her move from India to Scotland contains parallel themes and adventures akin to themes within her novels.<br /><br />Kirkus Reviews:<br />The first half of Rumer Godden\'s 90 years were spent in India and many of her books are based on her experiences there. They have been likened to Paul Scott\'s Jewel in the Crown for the light they throw on the last years of the Raj. She was no conventional English rose and shocked society by starting her own dancing school in Calcutta, accepting European pupils and later, leaving her feckless husband to live alone with his two daughters in the hills. Her novel The River, made into a film by Jean Renoir, mirrors her idyllic childhood. Black Narcissus, which made her famous, shows English nuns near Darjeeling struggling, as she did, to understand intractable Indian traditions and King Fishers Catch Fire is the story of a horrific event in her own life when a Kashmiri cook put ground glass into the family\'s food. This event drove her home to England where she divorced and later became a Catholic (the background to The House of Brede). Basing her biography on talks with Godden, letters and interviews, Anne Chisholm has given us a book that is as compulsively readable as the work of her complex and vivid subject. (Kirkus UK)<br /><br />Although Godden spent much of her life in exotic climes and has proven to be one of the few truly successful "crossover" writers, this sprawling biography will neither draw nor hold the attention of readers. Chisholm pads a narrative already filled with eye-glazing details of decades of comings and goings, minor meetings, and social events by taking side excursions to describe the making of films and other tangential episodes; she pays scant attention to Godden\'s children\'s books, and never considers how or why the author wrote for that audience. Published in England in 1998, this doesn\'t cover Godden\'s last months (she died near the end of the year). It\'s a mountain of undigested information, richer in itinerary than insight.

While traveling to the country house of Newmarch for a weekend party, the nameless narrator becomes obsessed with the idea that a person may become younger or cleverer by tapping the "sacred fount" of another person. Convinced that Grace Brissenden has become younger by drawing upon her husband, Guy, the narrator seeks to discover the source of the newfound wit of Gilbert Long, previously "a fine piece of human furniture." His perplexing and ambiguous quest, and the varying reactions it provokes from the other guests, calls into question the imaginative inquiry central to James\'s art of the novel. <br /><br /><br /><br />James described the essential idea of <i>The Wings of the Dove</i> as "a young person conscious of a great capacity for life, but early stricken and doomed, condemned to die under short respite, while also enamoured of the world." The heroine, a wealthy young American heiress, Milly Theale (inspired by James\'s beloved cousin Minny Temple), is slowly drawn into a trap set for her by the English adventuress Kate Croy and her lover, the journalist Morton Densher. The unexpected outcome of their mercenary scheme provides the resolution to a tragic story of love and betrayal, innocence and experience that has long been acknowledged as one of James\'s supreme achievements as a novelist.

The year is 1965, the setting a university town in Connecticut, and serial killers are still referred to as "multiple murderers." Profiling hasn\'t even begun, so Delmonico has to go it alone on a frantic learning curve that has the killer always two steps ahead of him." "The story begins when parts of the body of a young woman are found in a research center for neurology privately funded by one of the university\'s greatest benefactors." "It swiftly develops that the killer is very possibly a member of the research facility and that this is not his first murder. With great cunning and daring, he targets a "type" of young woman, following which the women are subjected to unspeakable torture and rape, and finally a horrible death." "The suspects are many and varied, and include a wealthy and ambitious young Indian eager to win a Nobel Prize; the professional head of the institute, who does something peculiar in his basement; an internationally renowned epilepsy clinician; a neurochemist with a taste for fine food, wine, and music; a Japanese with rarefied and strange tastes; and a business manager named Desdemona Dupre, a tough, well-educated woman, full of common sense, for whom Delmonico feels a growing, risky attraction." As the serial murders begin to mount - the killer is getting more and more bloodthirsty and bold - and the media and anguished parents begin to put pressure on the governor, Delmonico and the forceful, enigmatic Miss Dupre are drawn deeper and deeper into the secrets of the suspects and toward an old family scandal as shocking as it is bizarre.

S'This is the first examination of the fragments of the solar theology of the Phoenicians. Beginning from the Emperor Julian\'s fourth-century statement that in the opinion of the Phoenicians \'the sunlight which is sent forth everywhere is the immaculate action of pure mind itself, \' this book contends that there existed an authentic and ancient Phoenician solar theology, similar to that described by Julian, reaching back to the sixth or fifth century BCE. Such a theology is described in Damaskios\' quotation from Mochos, the Sidonian philosopher. A passage from Philo of Byblos, preserved in John Lydus, and referring to "the noetic light," strengthens this argument. Phoenician funerary inscriptions are examined, together with relevant artistic evidence and some surviving accounts of Phoenician thought. Altogether, a portrait of Phoenician spiritual thought emerges: a native tradition not dependent upon Hellenic thought, but related to other Semitic cultures of the ancient Near East, and, of course, to Egypt. Many themes and motifs from ancient Phoenician religion are discussed, such as the phoenix bird (the "Phoenician" bird) which was associated with the concept of immortality, and the possibility that there was a Phoenician cult of "Yhwh." The book abstracts seven ideas from the extant material as axial concepts. In light of this analysis, it can be seen that Phoenician religion possessed a unique organizing power, in which the sun, the sun god, life, death, and humanity, were linked in a profound system, which seems to have been common amongst the Phoenician city states.'

S'On the evening of 26th November 1703, a cyclone from the north Atlantic hammered into southern Britain at over seventy miles an hour, claiming the lives of over 8,000 people. Eyewitnesses reported seeing cows left stranded in the branches of trees and windmills ablaze from the friction of their whirling sails. For Defoe, bankrupt and just released from prison for seditious writings, the storm struck during one of his bleakest moments. <br />But it also furnished him with the material for his first book, and in his powerful depiction of private suffering and individual survival played out against a backdrop of public calamity we can trace the outlines of his later masterpieces such as A Journal of the Plague Year and Robinson Crusoe.'

S"Full of enthusiasm, young English schoolmaster Mr. Chipping came to teach at Brookfield in 1870. It was a time when dignity and a generosity of spirit still existed, and the dedicated new schoolmaster expressed these beliefs to his rowdy students. Nicknamed Mr. Chips, this gentle and caring man helped shape the lives of generation after generation of boys. He became a legend at Brookfield, as enduring as the institution itself. And sad but grateful faces told the story when the time came for the students at Brookfield to bid their final goodbye to Mr. Chips.<br /><br />There is not another book, with the possible exception of Dickens's <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, that has quite the same hold on readers' affections. James Hilton wrote <i>Good-Bye, Mr. Chips</i> in loving memory of his schoolmaster father and in tribute to his profession. Over the years it has won an enduring place in world literature and made untold millions of people smile -- with a catch in the throat."

As The New York Times noted recently: "Now that the Israelis and the Palestinians have finally given each other official recognition, they are free to search for human recognition." Such human recognition is one of the enduring themes of The Sea af Stones, a bittersweet love story that spans decades, continents, and clashing cultures. This first novel also chronicles one woman\'s brave, desperate attempts to find her son in the slaughter of war. It is 1982. Freya, recently divorced, cares for her aging father in Chicago. Her only son, Noah, lives on a kibbutz. Without telling his mother, he has joined the Israeli army, now embroiled in a war in Lebanon. Freya flies to Israel to find him and along the way befriends an Israeli Arab woman. In Jerusalem, she resumes a romance with Asher, her lover from decades earlier and now a general in Israeli intelligence. With his help, she enters Lebanon. Freya, scared and in love - caught in a sea of bitter and bewitched personalities - struggles to save her son in a world of incomprehensible hostilities and carnage.'

Because of the absence of misfit effects, homoepitaxy is an ideal playground to study growth kinetics in its pure form.

This book explains the formation of such patterns in terms of elementary atomic processes, using the well-studied Pt/Pt(111) system as a reference point and a large number of Scanning Tunneling Microscopy images for visualization. Topics include surface diffusion, nucleation theory, island shapes, mound formation and coarsening, and layer-by-layer growth.

He analyzes fashion trends, smoking, children\'s television, direct mail, and the early days of the American Revolution for clues about making ideas infectious, and visits a religious commune, a successful high-tech company, and one of the world\'s greatest salesmen to show how to start and sustain social epidemics.'

[Shepard] has put his finger on seemingly all of the popular (and some less common) misconceptions of both Gandhi and his philosophy, including some particularly important ones. . . . This book takes little space to cover its topic concisely and well. It would be [some] of the most valuable pages many people could read about Gandhi." -- Global Conscience, July-Sept. 1990<br /><br />/////////////////////////////////////////////////<br /><br />SAMPLE<br /><br />I suspect that most of the myths and misconceptions surrounding Gandhi have to do with nonviolence. For instance, it\'s surprising how many people still have the idea that nonviolent action is passive.<br /><br />It\'s important for us to be clear about this: There is nothing passive about Gandhian nonviolent action.<br /><br />I\'m afraid Gandhi himself helped create this confusion by referring to his method at first as "passive resistance," because it was in some ways like techniques bearing that label. But he soon changed his mind and rejected the term.<br /><br />Gandhi\'s nonviolent action was not an evasive strategy nor a defensive one. Gandhi was always on the offensive. He believed in confronting his opponents aggressively, in such a way that they could not avoid dealing with him.<br /><br />But wasn\'t Gandhi\'s nonviolent action designed to avoid violence? Yes and no. Gandhi steadfastly avoided violence toward his opponents. He did not avoid violence toward himself or his followers.<br /><br />Gandhi said that the nonviolent activist, like any soldier, had to be ready to die for the cause. And in fact, during India\'s struggle for independence, hundreds of Indians were killed by the British.<br /><br />The difference was that the nonviolent activist, while willing to die, was never willing to kill.<br /><br />Gandhi pointed out three possible responses to oppression and injustice. One he described as the coward\'s way: to accept the wrong or run away from it. The second option was to stand and fight by force of arms. Gandhi said this was better than acceptance or running away.<br /><br />But the third way, he said, was best of all and required the most courage: to stand and fight solely by nonviolent means.'

S"More than two millennia ago the famous Chinese general Sun Tzu wrote the classic work on military strategy, The Art of War. Now, in Sun Tzu and the Art of Business, Mark R. McNeilly shows how Sun Tzu's strategic principles can be successfully applied to modern business situations. Here are really two books in one: McNeilly's synthesis of Sun Tzu's ideas into six strategic principles for the business executive, plus the entire text of Samuel B. Griffith's popular translation of The Art of War. Within, McNeilly explains how to gain market share without inciting competitive retaliation, how to attack a competitor's weak points, and how to maximize the power of market information for competitive advantage. He also demonstrates the value of speed, preparation, and secrecy in throwing the competition off-balance, employing strategy to beat the competition, and the need for character in successful leaders. In his final chapter, McNeilly presents a practical method to put Sun Tzu and The Art of Business into practice. By using modern examples throughout the book from GE, Microsoft, AT&amp;T, BMW, Southwest Airlines, FedEx, and many others, he illustrates how, by following the wisdom of history's most respected strategist, executives can avoid the pitfalls of management fads and achieve lasting competitive advantage."

S"Even when the greatness of the founding fathers isn't being debunked, it is a quality that feels very far away from us indeed: Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison and Co. seem as distant as marble faces carved high into a mountainside. We may marvel at the fact that fate placed such a talented cohort of political leaders in that one place, the east coast of North America, in colonies between Virginia and Massachusetts, and during that one fateful period, but that doesn't really help us explain it or teach us the proper lessons to draw from it. What did make the founders different? Now, the incomparable Gordon Wood has written a book that shows us, among many other things, just how much character did matter. <br /><br /><i>Revolutionary Characters</i> offers a series of brilliantly illuminating studies of the men who came to be known as the founding fathers. Each life is considered in the round, but the thread that binds the work together and gives it the cumulative power of a revelation is this idea of character as a lived reality for these men. For these were men, Gordon Wood shows, who took the matter of character very, very seriously. They were the first generation in history that was self-consciously self-made, men who understood the arc of lives, as of nations, as being one of moral progress. They saw themselves as comprising the world's first true meritocracy, a natural aristocracy as opposed to the decadent Old World aristocracy of inherited wealth and station. <br /><br /> Gordon Wood's wondrous accomplishment here is to bring these men and their times down to earth and within our reach, showing us just who they were and what drove them. In so doing, he shows us that although a lot has changed in two hundred years, to an amazing degree the virtues these founders defined for themselves are the virtues we aspire to still."

Compact, it is perfect for those seeking greater spiritual depth. As a contemporary Book of Hours, <i>The Divine Hours: Prayers for Autumn and Wintertime</i> heralds a renewal of the tradition of disciplined daily prayer, and gives those already using the first volume the continuity they are seeking.

S'A breakthrough book in the emergent fields of improvisation and cultural theory, The Other Side of Nowhere conveys the spirit and energy of an experimental celebration. The volume is divided into four sections: writings of musicians about improvising; examinations of inter- and cross-cultural dialogue; discussions of social practice and identity; and essays about collaborative dissonance. The 17 essays present jazz improvisation as a cultural practice with far-reaching ramifications. Music is treated not merely as an artistic phenomenon, but as a social force with the power to effect substantial change among people of marginalized races, genders, sexualities and ethnicities. The collection argues that there is a distinctive relationship between the emergence of free jazz, the desire for social justice and activist practices. The Other Side of Nowhere is a groundbreaking book that offers multiple perspectives on the art of jazz improvisation--it will inspire readers to create, collaborate and dissent. <br />CONTRIBUTORS: John Corbett, Krin Gabbard, Michael Jarrett, George E.

S'In the years since Daniel Dennett\'s influential <i>Consciousness Explained</i> was published in 1991, scientific research on consciousness has been a hotly contested battleground of rival theories -- "so rambunctious," Dennett observes, "that several people are writing books just about the tumult." With <i>Sweet Dreams</i>, Dennett returns to the subject for "revision and renewal" of his theory of consciousness, taking into account major empirical advances in the field since 1991 as well as recent theoretical challenges.<br /><br />In <i>Consciousness Explained</i>, Dennett proposed to replace the ubiquitous but bankrupt Cartesian Theater model (which posits a privileged place in the brain where "it all comes together" for the magic show of consciousness) with the Multiple Drafts Model. Drawing on psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and artificial intelligence, he asserted that human consciousness is essentially the mental software that reorganizes the functional architecture of the brain. In <i>Sweet Dreams</i>, he recasts the Multiple Drafts Model as the "fame in the brain" model, as a background against which to examine the philosophical issues that "continue to bedevil the field."<br /><br />With his usual clarity and brio, Dennett enlivens his arguments with a variety of vivid examples. He isolates the "Zombic Hunch" that distorts much of the theorizing of both philosophers and scientists, and defends heterophenomenology, his "third-person" approach to the science of consciousness, against persistent misinterpretations and objections. The old challenge of Frank Jackson\'s thought experiment about Mary the color scientist is given a new rebuttal in the form of "RoboMary," while his discussion of a famous card trick, "The Tuned Deck," is designed to show that David Chalmers\'s Hard Problem is probably just a figment of theorists\' misexploited imagination. In the final essay, the "intrinsic" nature of "qualia" is compared with the naively imagined "intrinsic value" of a dollar in "Consciousness -- How Much is That in Real Money?"'

S"<br />This beautifully written book by one of the world's leading moral philosophers argues that the key to a fulfilled life is to pursue wholeheartedly what one cares about, that love is the most authoritative form of caring, and that the purest form of love is, in a complicated way, self-love.<br /> Harry Frankfurt writes that it is through caring that we infuse the world with meaning. Caring provides us with stable ambitions and concerns; it shapes the framework of aims and interests within which we lead our lives. The most basic and essential question for a person to raise about the conduct of his or her life is not what he or she should care about but what, in fact, he or she cannot help caring about.<br /> The most important form of caring, Frankfurt writes, is love, a nonvoluntary, disinterested concern for the flourishing of what is loved. Love is so important because meaningful practical reasoning must be grounded in ends that we do not seek only to attain other ends, and because it is in loving that we become bound to final ends desired for their own sakes.<br /> Frankfurt argues that the purest form of love is self-love. This sounds perverse, but self-love--as distinct from self-indulgence--is at heart a disinterested concern for whatever it is that the person loves. The most elementary form of self-love is nothing more than the desire of a person to love. Insofar as this is true, self-love is simply a commitment to finding meaning in our lives.<br />"

p2050
(lp2051
S'The life and times of Abraham Lincoln have been analyzed and dissected in countless books. Do we need another Lincoln biography? In <i>Team of Rivals</i>, esteemed historian Doris Kearns Goodwin proves that we do. Though she can\'t help but cover some familiar territory, her perspective is focused enough to offer fresh insights into Lincoln\'s leadership style and his deep understanding of human behavior and motivation. Goodwin makes the case for Lincoln\'s political genius by examining his relationships with three men he selected for his cabinet, all of whom were opponents for the Republican nomination in 1860: William H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase, and Edward Bates. These men, all accomplished, nationally known, and presidential, originally disdained Lincoln for his backwoods upbringing and lack of experience, and were shocked and humiliated at losing to this relatively obscure Illinois lawyer. Yet Lincoln not only convinced them to join his administration--Seward as secretary of state, Chase as secretary of the treasury, and Bates as attorney general--he ultimately gained their admiration and respect as well. How he soothed egos, turned rivals into allies, and dealt with many challenges to his leadership, all for the sake of the greater good, is largely what Goodwin\'s fine book is about. Had he not possessed the wisdom and confidence to select and work with the best people, she argues, he could not have led the nation through one of its darkest periods. <br /><br /> Ten years in the making, this engaging work reveals why "Lincoln\'s road to success was longer, more tortuous, and far less likely" than the other men, and why, when opportunity beckoned, Lincoln was "the best prepared to answer the call." This multiple biography further provides valuable background and insights into the contributions and talents of Seward, Chase, and Bates. Lincoln may have been "the indispensable ingredient of the Civil War," but these three men were invaluable to Lincoln and they played key roles in keeping the nation intact. --<i>Shawn Carkonen</i> <br /><br /><i>Team of Rivals</i> doesn\'t just tell the story of Abraham Lincoln. It is a multiple biography of the entire team of personal and political competitors that he put together to lead the country through its greatest crisis. Here, Doris Kearns Goodwin profiles five of the key players in her book, four of whom contended for the 1860 Republican presidential nomination and all of whom later worked together in Lincoln\'s cabinet.<br /><br /><strong>1. Edwin M. Stanton</strong><br />Stanton treated Lincoln with utter contempt at their initial acquaintance when the two men were involved in a celebrated law case in the summer of 1855. Unimaginable as it might seem after Stanton\'s demeaning behavior, Lincoln offered him "the most powerful civilian post within his gift"--the post of secretary of war--at their next encounter six years later. On his first day in office as Simon Cameron\'s replacement, the energetic, hardworking Stanton instituted "an entirely new regime" in the War Department. After nearly a year of disappointment with Cameron, Lincoln had found in Stanton the leader the War Department desperately needed. Lincoln\'s choice of Stanton revealed his singular ability to transcend personal vendetta, humiliation, or bitterness. As for Stanton, despite his initial contempt for the man he once described as a "long armed Ape," he not only accepted the offer but came to respect and love Lincoln more than any person outside of his immediate family. He was beside himself with grief for weeks after the president\'s death.<br /><br /><strong>2. Salmon P. Chase</strong><br />Chase, an Ohioan, had been both senator and governor, had played a central role in the formation of the national Republican Party, and had shown an unflagging commitment to the cause of the black man. No individual felt he <i>deserved</i> the presidency as a natural result of his past contributions more than Chase himself, but he refused to engage in the practical methods by which nominations are won. He had virtually no campaign and he failed to conciliate his many enemies in Ohio itself. As a result, he alone among the candidates came to the convention without the united support of his own state. Chase never ceased to underestimate Lincoln, nor to resent the fact that he had lost the presidency to a man he considered his inferior. His frustration with his position as secretary of the treasury was alleviated only by his his dogged hope that he, rather than Lincoln, would be the Republican nominee in 1864, and he steadfastly worked to that end. The president put up with Chase\'s machinations and haughty yet fundamentally insecure nature because he recognized his superlative accomplishments at treasury. Eventually, however, Chase threatened to split the Republican Party by continuing to fill key positions with partisans who supported his presidential hopes. When Lincoln stepped in, Chase tendered his resignation as he had three times before, but this time Lincoln stunned Chase by calling his bluff and accepting the offer.<br /><br /><strong>3. Abraham Lincoln</strong><br /> When Lincoln won the Republican presidential nomination in 1860 he seemed to have come from nowhere--a backwoods lawyer who had served one undistinguished term in the House of Representatives and lost two consecutive contests for the U.S. Senate. Contemporaries attributed his surprising nomination to chance, to his moderate position on slavery, and to the fact that he hailed from the battleground state of Illinois. But Lincoln\'s triumph, particularly when viewed against the efforts of his rivals, owed much to a remarkable, unsuspected political acuity and an emotional strength forged in the crucible of hardship and defeat. That Lincoln, after winning the presidency, made the unprecedented decision to incorporate his eminent rivals into his political family, the cabinet, was evidence of an uncanny self-confidence and an indication of what would prove to others a most unexpected greatness.<br /><br /><strong>4. William H. Seward</strong><br /> A celebrated senator from New York for more than a decade and governor of his state for two terms before going to Washington, Seward was certain he was going to receive his party\'s nomination for president in 1860. The weekend before the convention in Chicago opened he had already composed a first draft of the valedictory speech he expected to make to the Senate, assuming that he would resign his position as soon as the decision in Chicago was made. His mortification at not having received the nomination never fully abated, and when he was offered his cabinet post as secretary of state he intended to have a major role in choosing the remaining cabinet members, conferring upon himself a position in the new government more commanding than that of Lincoln himself. He quickly realized the futility of his plan to relegate the president to a figurehead role. Though the feisty New Yorker would continue to debate numerous issues with Lincoln in the years ahead, exactly as Lincoln had hoped and needed him to do, Seward would become his closest friend, advisor, and ally in the administration. More than any other cabinet member Seward appreciated Lincoln\'s peerless skill in balancing factions both within his administration and in the country at large.<br /><br /><strong>5. Edward Bates</strong><br /> A widely respected elder statesman, a delegate to the convention that framed the Missouri Constitution, and a former Missouri congressman whose opinions on national matters were still widely sought, Bates\'s ambitions for political success were gradually displaced by love for his wife and large family, and he withdrew from public life in the late 1840s. For the next 20 years he was asked repeatedly to run or once again accept high government posts but he consistently declined. However in early 1860, with letters and newspaper editorials advocating his candidacy crowding in upon him, he decided to try for the highest office in the land. After losing to Lincoln he vowed, in his diary, to decline a cabinet position if one were to be offered, but with the country "in trouble and danger" he felt it was his duty to accept when Lincoln asked him to be attorney general. Though Bates initially viewed Lincoln as a well-meaning but incompetent administrator, he eventually concluded that the president was an unmatched leader, "very near being a \'perfect man.\'"'

Included among those traditions are the Golden Age detective story, the police procedural, the literary gothic, and the Victorian novel, with its stately prose, leisurely pacing, and abundant supply of social, familial, and psychological detail. The result of this eclectic combination is a multilayered narrative that works both as a murder mystery and as a complex meditation on faith, love, loyalty, vengeance, and personal responsibility.<br /><p><br />The bulk of the novel takes place at St. Anselm\'s, an embattled, isolated theological college on England\'s windswept East Anglian coast. When the body of seminarian Ronald Treeves is literally unearthed from a suffocating pile of sand, a coroner\'s jury turns in a verdict of accidental death. Arms manufacturer Sir Alred Treeves, Ronald\'s adoptive father, questions the verdict and arranges to have Dalgliesh reinvestigate the boy\'s death.<br /></p><p><br />Dalgliesh arrives at St. Anselm\'s at a particularly troubled moment.

S'<i>The Great Bridge</i> is an account of one of the greatest engineering feats of all time. Winning acclaim for its comprehensive look at the building of the Brooklyn Bridge, this book helped cement McCullough\'s reputation as a preeminent social historian. Now, <i>The Great Bridge</i> is reissued as a Simon &amp; Schuster Classic Edition with a new introduction by the author. It\'s the story of one of the greatest events in the nation\'s history during the Age of Optimism, a period when many Americans were convinced that all great things were possible. In the years around 1870, when the project was undertaken, the concept of building a bridge to span the East River between the great cities of Manhattan &amp; Brooklyn required a vision &amp; determination comparable to that which went into the building of the pyramids. Throughout the 14 years of its construction, the odds against the successful completion of the bridge seemed great. Bodies were broken, lives lost, political empires fell &amp; surges of public emotion constantly threatened the project. But this isn\'t merely the saga of an engineering feat. It\'s a sweeping narrative of the social climate of the time &amp; of the heroes &amp; rascals who had a hand in either constructing or obstructing the enterprise. Amid the flood of praise for the book when originally published, <i>Newsday</i> said succinctly "This is the definitive book on the event. Do not wait for a better try. There won\'t be any."'

S'Throughout human history, certain drinks have done much more than just quench thirst. As Tom Standage relates with authority and charm, six of them have had a surprisingly pervasive influence on the course of history, becoming the defining drink during a pivotal historical period. <br /><br /><i>A History of the World in 6 Glasses</i> tells the story of humanity from the Stone Age to the 21st century through the lens of beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea, and cola. Beer was first made in the Fertile Crescent and by 3000 B.C.E. was so important to Mesopotamia and Egypt that it was used to pay wages. In ancient Greece wine became the main export of her vast seaborne trade, helping spread Greek culture abroad. Spirits such as brandy and rum fueled the Age of Exploration, fortifying seamen on long voyages and oiling the pernicious slave trade. Although coffee originated in the Arab world, it stoked revolutionary thought in Europe during the Age of Reason, when coffeehouses became centers of intellectual exchange. And hundreds of years after the Chinese began drinking tea, it became especially popular in Britain, with far-reaching effects on British foreign policy. Finally, though carbonated drinks were invented in 18th-century Europe they became a 20th-century phenomenon, and Coca-Cola in particular is the leading symbol of globalization.<br /><br />For Tom Standage, each drink is a kind of technology, a catalyst for advancing culture by which he demonstrates the intricate interplay of different civilizations. You may never look at your favorite drink the same way again.<br />'

Jobs are few and far between, and people aren't any nicer now than they were when Ghengis Khan ran around in big furs killing people in unfriendly acquisitions. For thousands of years, people have been reading the writings of the deeply wise, but also extremely dead Chinese philosopher Sun Tzu, who was perhaps the first to look on the waging of war as a strategic art that could be taught to people who wished to be warlords and other kinds of senior managers.<br /><br />In a nutshell, Sun Tzu taught that readiness is all, that knowledge of oneself and the enemy was the foundation of strength and that those who fight best are those who are prepared and wise enough not to fight at all. Unfortunately, in the current day, this approach is pretty much horse hockey, a fact that has not been recognized by the bloated, tree-hugging Sun Tzu industry, which churns out mushy-gushy pseudo-philosophy for business school types who want to make war and keep their hands clean.<br /><br /><em>Sun Tzu was a Sissy</em> will transcend all those efforts and teach the reader how to make war, win and enjoy the plunder in the real world, where those who do not kick, gouge and grab are left behind at the table to pay the tab. Students of Bing will be taught how to plan and execute battles that hurt other people a lot, and advance their flags and those of their friends, if possible.

In "The Secret Garden," David Bodanis takes us on an eye-opening journey through this mysterious domain where plants and insects engage daily in a Darwinian epic of survival.<br /><br />Ants navigate through a forest of grass blades, forming networks that act as a living "computer" to gather intelligence from the world above. Caterpillars attack a shrub, which in turn sends up a chemical signal to call for help from a passing wasp. Roots from different plants battle one another underground with sophisticated chemical weapons, releasing poisonous gases into the soil. A tiny triungulin, the juvenile form of a common beetle, launches itself from a geranium leaf to latch on to a passing bee. An oak tree registers where a beetle is biting into its bark and targets the damaged quadrant with dangerous poisons, while other trees puff out warning vapors when they\'re under attack by insects. Through it all wander a couple who are oblivious to the activity taking place around them and unaware of the effect their very presence has on the garden\'s environment.<br /><br />As in his wonderful previous book, "The Secret House," David Bodanis once again guides us through the terrain of the familiar yet unseen world around us and brilliantly transforms it. Written with the same witty style that the Washington Post called "marvelously captivating" and illustrated throughout with state-of-the-art microphotographs, "The Secret Garden" is an astonishing book that will fascinate and delight anyone who has ever set foot in a garden.\'<br /><br />(description from the book flap)'

S"Readers of this witty and fluent new translation of <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> should find themselves turning page after page: by recasting Chaucer's ten-syllable couplets into eight-syllable lines, Joseph Glaser achieves a lighter, more rapid cadence than other translators, a four-beat rhythm well-established in the English poetic tradition up to Chaucer's time. Glaser's shortened lines make compelling reading and mirror the elegance and variety of Chaucer's verse to a degree rarely met by translations that copy Chaucer beat for beat. Moreover, this translation's full, Chaucerian range of diction--from earthy to Latinate--conveys the great scope of Chaucer's interests and effects.<br /><br />The selection features complete translations of the majority of the stories, including all of the more familiar tales and narrative links along with abridgments or summaries of the others. To reflect Chaucer's interest in poetic technique, Glaser presents the tales written in non-couplet stanzas in their original forms.<br /><br />An Introduction, marginal glosses, bibliography, and notes are also included."

p2202
(lp2203
S'A choral interlude distinctive to Greek Old Comedy, the parabasis treats a variety of literary and political topics that critics have generally considered tangential to the themes of the play in which it appears. Reading closely each of Aristophanes\' comedies, Thomas K. Hubbard here demonstrates that, far from being a digression or a relic of long-forgotten rituals, the parabasis provides a critical link between the identities of the poet, chorus, and protagonist, and between the play and its audience.<br /><br />The parabasis, according to Hubbard, offers an interesting theoretical problem: the seeming intrusion of autobiographical allusion and literary dogma into the poetic text. He argues that the parabasis is not in fact intrusive, but presents the poet\'s role and identity as a paradigm for the satirical concerns of the play. After a review of ancient theories of the comic and their modern counterparts, Hubbard examines the parabasis within the framework of Greek traditions of poetic self-awareness and self-citation.<br /><br />He shows that the function of the parabasis is primarily "intertextual," echoing not only other poets but also the comic poet himself. Hubbard maintains that the parabases of Aristophanes\' plays, taken together, form an important autobiographical subtext, which allows readers to trace the poet\'s career as he wished it to be seen. The poet, in his various struggles with Athenian society, is himself revealed to be a comic hero on a par with many of his protagonists.<br /><br />Analyzing Aristophanes\' plays sequentially through the lens of the parabasis, The Mask of Comedy gives us a new perspective on the significance of his entire dramatic corpus. It will be welcomed by classicists and by comparatists and literary theorists interested in the development of comedy.'

S'An intellectual dialogue of the highest plane achieved in America, the correspondence between John Adams and Thomas Jefferson spanned half a century and embraced government, philosophy, religion, quotidiana, and family griefs and joys. First meeting as delegates to the Continental Congress in 1775, they initiated correspondence in 1777, negotiated jointly as ministers in Europe in the 1780s, and served the early Republic--each, ultimately, in its highest office. At Jefferson\'s defeat of Adams for the presidency in 1800, they became estranged, and the correspondence lapses from 1801 to 1812, then is renewed until the death of both in 1826, fifty years to the day after the Declaration of Independence.Lester J. Cappon\'s edition, first published in 1959 in two volumes, provides the complete correspondence between these two men and includes the correspondence between Abigail Adams and Jefferson. Many of these letters have been published in no other modern edition, nor does any other edition devote itself exclusively to the exchange between Jefferson and the Adamses. Introduction, headnotes, and footnotes inform the reader without interrupting the speakers. This reissue of "The Adams-Jefferson Letters in a one-volume unabridged edition brings to a broader audience one of the monuments of American scholarship and, to quote C.

This pattern was repeated by blacks with whom they shared a subculture in the South. Over the last half century poor whites and most blacks have moved up in class and affluence, but the ghetto remains filled with black rednecks. Their attempt to escape, Sowell shows, is hampered by their white liberal friends who turn dysfunctional black redneck culture into a sacrosanct symbol of racial identity.

p2286
(lp2287
S'This book is a detailed study of a single poem -- Horace, <i>Odes 1.9 -- often called \'The Soracte Ode\' after the mountain named in its second line. Although more than seventy articles and parts of books have been devoted to this twenty-four line poem since the beginning of the last century, Lowell Edmunds is the first scholar to apply developments in literary theory from outside the field of classics to a discussion of the ode. Specifically, he uses Hans Robert Jauss\'s essay on Baudelaire\'s "Spleen (II)" as a model for his study.<br /><br />According to Edmunds, attempts to answer aesthetic questions about ancient lyric poems typically begin with philological or historical facts -- which scholars present as new evidence, heretofore undiscovered or misunderstood -- and proceed to an analysis built on those facts. Edmunds argues that contemporary literary theory provides a different way of reconciling the aestheic and historical claims of a lyric poem, ancient or modern. He then takes a fresh look at Horace\'s poem, employing Jauss\'s method of performing three successive readings of the text: the first aesthetic or perceptual, the second interpretive, and the third historicist.<br /><br />In this hermeneutic Jaussian approach, Edmunds shows, the unity of the poem appears in the process of reading rather than, as in a philological approach, in the analysis of it. Moreover, he labels an emphasis on the act of reading itself, distinct from analysis, as the main difference between philological and hermeneutical ways of understanding a poem. Focusing on this contrast, he surveys the history of the ode\'s reception and scholarly interpretation. In the final chapter, he briefly considers deconstruction as an alternative critical method. Assessing the rival claims of hermeneutics, deconstruction, and philology as interpretive tools, Edmunds concludes by favoring hermeneutics.<br /><br />Originally published in 1992.<br /><br />A UNC Press Enduring Edition -- UNC Press Enduring Editions use the latest in digital technology to make available again books from our distinguished backlist that were previously out of print.

This timely volume considers the benefits of incorporating findings from cognitive neuroscience into the fields of educational, developmental, and cognitive psychology. The book provides a basic foundation in the methodology of brain research; describes the factors that affect brain development; and reviews salient findings on attention, memory, emotion, and reading and mathematics. For each domain, the author considers the ways that the neuroscientific evidence overlaps with or diverges from existing psychological models. Readers gain skills for assessing the credibility of widely publicized claims regarding critical periods of learning, the effects of stress hormones on the brain, the role of music training in boosting academic performance, and more. Also elucidated are the possible neuroscientific bases of attention deficits, reading problems, and mathematical disabilities in children. The volume concludes by suggesting areas for future investigation that may help answer important questions about individual and developmental differences in learning.<br />'

He believed the combination of these states produced the highest forms of music and tragic drama, which not only reveal the truth about suffering in life, but also provide a consolation for it.

A kind of vigorous supervisory humour is his natural idiom as a writer, and one particular attraction of his shorter work is the fresh further display it offers of this prime element in his literary character."<br /><br />The town-ho\'s story --<br />Bartleby, the scrivener : a story of Wall-Street --<br />Cock-a-doodle-doo! or, The crowing of the noble cock Beneventano --<br />The encantadas or Enchanted Isles --<br />The two temples --<br />Poor man\'s pudding and rich man\'s crumbs --The happy failure : a story of the river Hudson --<br />The lightning-rod man --<br />The fiddler --<br />The paradise of bachelors and the tartarus of maids --<br />The bell-tower --<br />Benito Cereno --<br />Jimmy Rose --<br />I and my chimney --<br />The \'Gees --<br />The apple-tree table, or Original spiritual manifestations --<br />The piazza --<br />The Marquis de Grandvin --<br />Three "Jack Gentian sketches" --<br />John Marr --<br />Daniel Orme --<br />Billy Budd, sailor.'

Madriani\'s client is an enigma, a career soldier who refuses to talk about his past, though clearly he is a battle-tested pro. The victim was an alluring businesswoman and software tycoon whose empire catered to the military, and the most damning evidence is the weapon that killed her: a handgun used solely in special operations where the double tap is the trademark of the most skilled assassins.</p><p>Madriani begins to have new fears about his client, a man who would rather sit on a legal time bomb than talk about his past and get a chance at acquittal. And yet more troubling, Madriani discovers that the victim was involved in a controversial government contract to combat terrorism by combing through the private computer records of millions of American citizens.</p><p>Madriani faces a wilderness of mirrors in a courtroom battle where every witness can hide behind "national security," where information is power and digital information is absolute power. It is a war in which the scales of justice are being tipped by evasion, deceit - and murder. Finding the unvarnished truth has never been so elusive - or so dangerous.</p>'

Based on proven theories outlined in Christensen's landmark books The Innovator's Dilemma and The Innovator's Solution, Seeing What's Next offers a practical, three-part model that helps decision-makers spot the signals of industry change, determine the outcome of competitive battles, and assess whether a firm's actions will ensure or threaten future success. Through in-depth case studies of industries from aviation to health care, the authors illustrate the predictive power of innovation theory in action."

In his journal he chronicles his daily battle to stay alive, as he conquers isolation, fashions shelter and clothes, first encounters another human being and fights off cannibals and mutineers. With <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, Defoe wrote what is regarded as the first English novel, and created one of the most popular and enduring myths in literature. Written in an age of exploration and enterprise, it has been variously interpreted as an embodiment of British imperialist values, as a portrayal of 'natural man' or as a moral fable. But above all it is a brilliant narrative, depicting Crusoe's transformation from terrified survivor to self-sufficient master of his island.<br /><br />This edition contains a full chronology of Defoe's life and times, explanatory notes, glossary and a critical introduction discussing Robinson Crusoe as a pioneering work of modern psychological realism."

S'Aristotle, great Greek philosopher, researcher, reasoner, and writer, born at Stagirus in 384 BCE, was the son of Nicomachus, a physician, and Phaestis. He studied under Plato at Athens and taught there (367 47); subsequently he spent three years at the court of a former pupil, Hermeias, in Asia Minor and at this time married Pythias, one of Hermeias s relations. After some time at Mitylene, in 343 2 he was appointed by King Philip of Macedon to be tutor of his teen-aged son Alexander. After Philip s death in 336, Aristotle became head of his own school (of Peripatetics ), the Lyceum at Athens. Because of anti-Macedonian feeling there after Alexander s death in 323, he withdrew to Chalcis in Euboea, where he died in 322. Nearly all the works Aristotle prepared for publication are lost; the priceless ones extant are lecture-materials, notes, and memoranda (some are spurious). They can be categorized as follows: I. Practical: "Nicomachean Ethics"; "Great Ethics" ("Magna Moralia"); "Eudemian Ethics"; "Politics"; "Oeconomica" (on the good of the family); "Virtues and Vices."<br /><br />II. Logical: "Categories"; "On Interpretation"; "Analytics" ("Prior" and "Posterior"); "On Sophistical Refutations"; "Topica."<br /><br />III. Physical: Twenty-six works (some suspect) including astronomy, generation and destruction, the senses, memory, sleep, dreams, life, facts about animals, etc.<br /><br />IV. "Metaphysics" on being as being.<br /><br />V. On Art: "Art of Rhetoric" and "Poetics."<br /><br />VI. Other works including the "Athenian Constitution"; more works also of doubtful authorship.<br /><br />VII. Fragments of various works such as dialogues on philosophy and literature; and of treatises on rhetoric, politics and metaphysics.

His frank, often humorous descriptions in his 1842 account cover everything from his uncomfortable sea voyage to an ecstatic narrative of his visit to Niagara Falls. Yet Dickens is also critical of American society, its preoccupation with money, and reliance on slavery, as well as the rude, unsavory manners of Americans and their corrupt press. Above all, American Notes is a lively chronicle of what was for Dickens an illuminating encounter with the New World.'

S'"The Worm Ouroboros," first published in 1922, is the most acclaimed fantasy novel predating J.R.R. Tolkien\'s "The Lord of the Rings." It concerns the schemes and great wars of imaginary heroes, men called by names such as Witches, Demons, Goblins, Imps and Pixies, but men nonetheless. The scenery is spectacular, from the vivid landscapes to the sumptuous thrones and costumes. Eddison\'s invented world comes to life with his vibrant and real characters, and the language in which he tells his tale. This book, along with the works of Tolkien, Dunsany and others, shaped modern fantasy and as such is a cornerstone of fantasy literature. Introduction by Douglas A. Anderson, author of "The Annotated Hobbit" and series editor for Cold Spring Press fantasy classics.?I read the works of Eddison ? with great enjoyment for their sheer literary merit. ?

Then into her office comes Dean Belden, a well-heeled client in search of a lawyer to help him set up a business in the islands. Within days Belden is subpoenaed to appear before a federal grand jury. Less than an hour after testifying, and before Joss can discover what happened in the secrecy of the grand jury room, Belden dies in a fiery explosion of his float plane on Seattle\'s Lake Union. Gideon Van Ry is a nuclear fission expert and a scholar in residence at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies in Monterey, California. One of his duties is to update the Center\'s database, an extensive catalog listing fissionable materials and weapons of mass destruction. Gideon is troubled by the apparent failure to account for two small tactical nuclear devices missing from a storage facility in the former Soviet Union.The two weapons were last seen in packing crates, to be shipped to an American company called Belden Electronics.

S'Widely acknowledged as the greatest of his later works, this story of switched babies and slavery is Twain\'s darkest vision of race in America. It began life as a slapstick comedy about Siamese twins, but as he wrote, something deepened. "The tale kept spreading along, and spreading along, and other people got to intruding themselves and taking up more and more time with their talk and their affairs. It changed from a farce to a tragedy while I was going along with it," Twain wrote in his frank afternote to the novel. In the end, the voice that comes to dominate the tale is Roxana\'s, a light-skinned slave who switches her infant son with her master\'s son to keep him from being sold down the river. Roxana, Twain\'s most complex and fully-realized adult female character, is a compelling and memorable tragic heroine, trapped with her son by the brutal system of slavery and by their own inescapable racial identities. At his best, Twain is the most uniquely American of writers, and it is inevitable that his best work revolves around the issues of race and of slavery embedded in the American psyche. The Tragedy of Pudd\'nhead Wilson is a dark and powerful novel of race in America, written by the American master.'

Echoes of both are found in this book, the ta!e of a community undergoing a trial which questions the whole basis of their justice, and love story across a divided society. Yet Guterson's work is unmistakably his own, original, memorable, capturing time and place in a poetic and reflective style that is always deeply moving. <br /><br />On San Piedro, an island of rugged, spectacular beauty in the Puget Sound, a Japanese-American fisherman stands trial, charged with cold-blooded murder. It is 1954 and the shadow of World War II, with its brutality abroad and the internment of Japanese-Americans at home, hangs over the courtroom. Ishmael Chambers, who lost an arm in the war and now runs the island newspaper, is among the journalists <br />covering the trial that brings him close, once again, to Hatsue Miyamoto, the wife of the accused and Ishmael's never-forgotten first love. As a heavy snowfall impedes the course of the trial, the whole community Is faced with the ambiguities of justice, the racism that persists even between neighbours, and the necessity of individual moral action, despite the indifference of nature and circumstance. <br /><br />Peter Marinker is a highly experienced stage actor whose credits include <i>The Iceman Cometh</i> and <i>Edward H</i> among many others.

p2706
(lp2707
S"This startling and original study emerged from Kenneth Rockford's wish to vindicate Aristophanes' <i>Clouds</i> against detractors. As a result of years of rereading and teaching Aristophanes, he realized that the <i>Clouds</i> could not be defended in an analysis of that play in isolation. A better approach, he decided, would be to define a comic perspective within which Aristophanes' comedies in general as well as the <i>Clouds</i> in particular could be appreciated.<br /><br />This first volume of Reckford's defense examines the comedies as a whole in a series of defining essays, each with its own dominant concern and method of approach. The author begins by exploring not the usual questions of Aristophanes' political attitudes and his place in the development of comedy, but rather the festive, celebratory, and Dionysian nature of Old Comedy. Here and throughout the book Reckford illustrates Aristophanes' form of comedy with analogies to Rabelais, Shakespeare, Charlie Chaplin, <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, and <i>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</i>.<br /><br />In the remaining essays Reckford goes beyond the usual Freudian approaches, reinterpreting the comic catharsis as a clarification of wishing and hoping. He also explores the growth of plays from comic idea to comic performance, in ways reflected in Tom Stoppard's plays today. Only then are Aristophanes' basic political loyalties described, as well as the place of his old- and-new comedy within the history of the genre.<br /><br />In a book that is as much about comedy generally as it is about Aristophanes specifically, some plays are treated more fully than others. Reckford discusses the <i>Wasps</i> at length, comparing the symbolic transformations and comic recognitions in the play with dream experience and dream interpretation. He also analyzes the <i>Peace</i>, the <i>Acharians</i>, the <i>Birds</i>, and the <i>Frogs</i>. Reckford's vindication of the <i>Clouds</i> will appear in the second volume of his defense, <i>Clouds of Glory</i>.<br /><br />Reckford's playful translations preserve the puns and anachronisms of Aristophanes, maintaining the playwright's comic feeling and tone. Combining traditional classical scholarship with a variety of literary, psychological, and anthropological approaches, he has written a study that will appeal to both the academic audience and the general reader who cares about comedy.<br /><br />Originally published in 1987.<br /><br />A UNC Press Enduring Edition -- UNC Press Enduring Editions use the latest in digital technology to make available again books from our distinguished backlist that were previously out of print.

Lord Voldemort is acting out in the open, continuing his reign of terror which was temporarily stopped almost 15 years beforehand. Harry is again at the Dursleys, where the events of the previous month continue to weigh on his mind, although not as much as the impending visit from his Headmaster, Albus Dumbledore. Given their last meeting, Harry is understandably confused as to why the old wizard would want to visit him at home.<br /><br />Rowling opens with a chapter she had wanted to use for the first book, of The Philosopher's Stone--Lord Voldemort has been creating chaos in the Wizard and Muggle communities alike, the war is in full swing and the Wizarding community now lives in fear. The press have been questioning the events at the Ministry which led to the admission of Voldemort's return, and of course Harry's name is mentioned a number of times. Harry's got his problems, but his anxiety is nothing compared to Hermione's when the OWL results are delivered. There's a new Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher, an assortment of new characters and creatures, and startling revelations about past characters and events. <br /><br />Gone is the rage-filled Harry of The Order of the Phoenix--he's not being kept in the dark any more, his unjustified Quidditch ban has been lifted and he has matured considerably in his short time out of school. Half-Blood Prince follows Harry into the world of late-teens, and his realisation that nobody is infallible has made his growth that much easier. Accepting his destiny, Harry continues to behave as teenagers do, enjoying his time with his friends, developing his relationships outside of his usual circle, and learning more about how he must, eventually, do what he is destined to do. <br /><br />J.K.

The theory and history of cinema play a particularly important role in the book.

p2770
(lp2771
S'Origen\'s Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans illustrates the centrality of the Holy Spirit for his theological project. As both God\'s exitus into the world and humanity\'s reditus to God, the Spirit forms the crucial link between Origen\'s doctrine of God and his spiritual anthropology. Origen\'s images for the Holy Spirit, understood in the context of second century concepts of "spirit," convey the intersection of theology and anthropology in his thought. His picture of the Holy Spirit as the Teacher of the saints, in particular, draws from Origen\'s own pedagogical experience a way of expressing both the Spirit\'s patient love for humanity and the active human involvement in the Spirit\'s work in the world. This book explores Origen\'s understanding of the multiplicity of spirits found in the Scriptures, with particular emphasis on the Holy Spirit, the loftiest of all spirit-beings, who emerges as the unique pedagogical center of Origen\'s Spirit-School. As such, the Spirit is pivotal to God\'s outreach into the world, necessarily involved in the human soul of Jesus Christ and in that of every human being healed by Jesus. Interpreted through the scriptural language of Cherub, Ring, and Teacher, the Holy Spirit is the sign both of God\'s love and of human love and the mutual edification of the Christian community. Origen\'s pneumatology serves as an inspiration for theologians today, who seek to integrate the Spirit fully into their work, rather than just paying lip-service to the Spirit\'s Person and action.'

At the same time, it explores the implications that remain undeveloped in Becker\'s "The Denial of Death," implications about gender, about modern technocratic life and about popular culture as blocks to heroism.

Over the years he wrote a mass of letters -- to his publishers, his family, to friends, and to fans of his books -- which record the history and composition of his works and his reaction to subsequent events.<br /><br />By turns thoughtful, impish, scholarly, impassioned, playful, vigorous, and gentle, Tolkien poured his heart and mind into a great stream of correspondence to intimate friends and unknown admirers all over the world. From this collection one sees a mind of immense complexity and many layers -- artistic, religious, charmingly eccentric, sentimental, and ultimately brilliant.<br /><br />Now newly expanded with a detailed index, this collection provides an invaluable record that sheds much light on Tolkien's creative genius, his thoughts and feelings about his own work, and the evolution of his grand design for the creation of a whole new world -- Middle-earth.<br />"

This fascinating book insightfully surveys the relationship of science, reason, and religion, giving special attention to the most contentious topics -- cosmology, evolution, and miracles.<br /><br />Providing a superb introduction to the philosophy of science, Dowe's <i>Galileo, Darwin, and Hawking</i> contends that there are four basic ways to relate science and religion. Two of them, <i>naturalism</i> and <i>religious science</i>, present these endeavors as antagonistic. By contrast, an <i>independence</i> view understands them as wholly unrelated. Finally, an <i>interaction</i> account sees religion and science as complementary -- perhaps even dependent on one another. Dowe finds this last perspective the most historically and philosophically compelling. He argues his case by exploring the history of science, highlighting the life and work of three scientific giants: Galileo Galilei, Charles Darwin, and Stephen Hawking."

This is an empirical study in which "politically correct" theory is repeatedly confronted with facts, and the sharp contradictions between the two are explained in terms of a set of self-congratulatory assumptions held by political and intellectual elites. These elites - the anointed - often consider themselves "thinking people," but this thinking is actually rhetorical assertion, followed by evasions of mounting evidence against these assertions. The vision of the anointed is seen not merely as a failure but as a fatal danger to the values and the future of American society.'

Above all we recognize the unmistakable voice of the author of such novels as Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility. We see the shift in her writing from witty and amusing descriptions of the social life of town and country, to a thoughtful and constructive tone while writing about the business of literary composition.<br /> R.W. Chapman's ground-breaking edition of the collected Letters first appeared in 1932, and a second edition followed twenty years later. Now in this third edition of Jane Austen's Letters, Deirdre Le Faye has added new material that has come to light since 1952, and re-ordered the letters into their correct chronological sequence. She has provided discreet and full annotation to each letter, including its provenance, and information on the watermarks, postmarks, and other physical details of the manuscripts, together with new biographical, topographical, and general indexes. Teachers, students, and fans of Jane Austen, at all levels, will find remarkable insight into one of the most popular novelists ever."

These pieces encompass the pre- and postwar Irish American family life she circles in the early <i>Temporary Shelter</i> series, as well as a wealth of new fiction that brings her contemporary characters into middle age; it is their turn to face bodily decline, mortality, and the more complex anxieties of modern life. Gordon captures the sharp scent of feelings as they shift, the shape of particular lives in their hope and incomprehensibility. <br /><br />In The Neighborhood, a seven-year-old who has lost her father finds birthday parties, with their noisy games and spun-sugar roses on fancy cakes, her greatest trial. City Life explores the dark side of Manhattan apartment living. Intertextuality proposes a dream meeting between Proust's characters and the author's aging grandmother. Throughout, Gordon's surprising path to the center of a story is as much a part of the tale as the self-understanding her characters achieve in the process: What were they all, any of them, feeling?one narrator ventures. This was the sort of question no one in my family would ask. Feelings were for others: the weak, the idle. We were people who got on with things.<br /><br />With their powerful insights into how we make do, both socially and privately, these stories are a treasure of American fiction. Each is a joy to read and a chance to savor Gordon's clear vision: her ability to reveal at every turn what we need and what we wish for, and her willingness, always, to address what comes of such precious wishes."

It was selected for the prestigious American Institute of Graphic Arts Book Show. Now, this newly expanded edition is revised and updated to address the latest developments in electronic page design, digital type, and the revolutionary creative possibilities unleashed by these important advances. This second edition covers all aspects of designing with type, including basic terms, classification, and an extensively revised section on visual organization and typographic space. Electronic page design, also called desktop publishing, has been added to the chapter on technology. The widely acclaimed chapter on legibility has new material about legibility and the computer. Nearly 550 photographs and line images provide readers with a keen understanding of typeface usage and clarify typographic fundamentals. Theoretical and structural problem-solving approaches by design educators across America reveal underlying concepts about typographic form and message. Case studies by leading professionals provide insight into the typographic design process. Type specimens representing major categories enable readers to study typographic classification and form subtlety. Four pictorial timelines show the evolution of typography and writing within the context of world events, architectural developments, and art history. These chronologies range from the origins of writing over 5,000 years ago to the latest typesetting technology. They take readers on a fascinating journey through the invention of movable type, explosion of new typographic forms during the industrial revolution, aesthetic concerns of modernism, and functional and expressive communications in the post-industrial world.

p2950
(lp2951
S"This beautifully written book by one of the world's leading moral philosophers argues that the key to a fulfilled life is to pursue wholeheartedly what one cares about, that love is the most authoritative form of caring, and that the purest form of love is, in a complicated way, self-love.<br /><br />Harry Frankfurt writes that it is through caring that we infuse the world with meaning. Caring provides us with stable ambitions and concerns; it shapes the framework of aims and interests within which we lead our lives. The most basic and essential question for a person to raise about the conduct of his or her life is not what he or she should care about but what, in fact, he or she cannot help caring about.<br /><br />The most important form of caring, Frankfurt writes, is love, a nonvoluntary, disinterested concern for the flourishing of what is loved. Love is so important because meaningful practical reasoning must be grounded in ends that we do not seek only to attain other ends, and because it is in loving that we become bound to final ends desired for their own sakes.<br /><br />Frankfurt argues that the purest form of love is self-love. This sounds perverse, but self-love--as distinct from self-indulgence--is at heart a disinterested concern for whatever it is that the person loves. The most elementary form of self-love is nothing more than the desire of a person to love. Insofar as this is true, self-love is simply a commitment to finding meaning in our lives."

p2958
(lp2959
S'Aid to promote democracy abroad has emerged as a major growth industry in recent years. Not only the United States but many other Western countries, international institutions, and private foundations today use aid to support democratic transitions in Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. Though extensive in scope, these activities remain little understood outside the realm of specialists. Debates among policymakers over democracy promotion oscillate between unhelpful poles of extreme skepticism and unrealistic boosterism, while the vast majority of citizens in aid-providing countries have little awareness of the democracy-building efforts their governments sponsor. Aiding Democracy Abroad is the first independent, comprehensive assessment of this important new field. Drawing on extensive field research and years of hands-on experience, Thomas Carothers examines democracy-aid programs relating to elections, political parties, governmental reform, rule of law, civil society, independent media, labor unions, decentralization, and other elements of what he describes as "the democracy template" that policymakers and aid officials apply around the world. Steering a careful path between the inflated claims of aid advocates and the exaggerated criticisms of their opponents, Carothers takes a hard look at what such programs achieve and how they can be improved.'

When it is remembered that Chaucer wrote in English at a time when Latin was the standard literary language across western Europe, the magnitude of his achievement is even more remarkable. But Chaucer's genius needs no historical introduction; it bursts forth from every page of <i>The Canterbury Tales.</i><br /><br />If we trust the General Prologue, Chaucer intended that each pilgrim should tell two tales on the way to Canterbury and two tales on the way back. He never finished his enormous project and even the completed tales were not finally revised. Scholars are uncertain about the order of the tales. As the printing press had yet to be invented when Chaucer wrote his works, The Canterbury Tales has been passed down in several handwritten manuscripts.</p>"

p2994
(lp2995
S'The five appearances of bishop lists in the early church mark the principal points at which apostolic succession of bishops emerged and developed into a crucial and well defined doctrine. Walter Bauer long ago termed these lists, legitimately if not charitably, oliterary propaganda.o This study delves into the political struggles surrounding the lists and the doctrine they served to define. The ancient Mediterranean world established legitimacy of authority in social institutions, whether Roman, Greek, Jewish, or Christian, by citing successions of leaders. In early catholic churches, apostolic succession was the linchpin in the three opillarso of tradition, succession, and canon. It guaranteed the first and assured interpretation of the third. A social history approach reveals political intrigue at every point of the development of the doctrine of apostolic succession. In crises of the first century, the New Testament recorded (monepiscopal?) bishops and succession, and Ignatius and 1 Clement make monepiscopacy and apostolic succession explicit. In the second and third centuries, writers employed episcopal successions in reaction to subsequent struggles with heresy and schism. By the fourth century, Eusebius employed succession lists for apologetic and edification. Ecclesiastical politics in each case reflects the threat to the bishopAEs authority and clarifies the meaning of apostolic succession in the ChurchAEs development. This social history approach, examining the function of the literature within its historical circumstances, reveals how theology developed from politics. The development is as gripping politically as it is illuminating theologically. Robert Lee Williams is Professor of Biblical Theology at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas. He has written a number of articles focused on New Testament and patristic topics from the vantage point of social-scientific methodology. Accordingly, Williams has been active in the SBL Social World of Early Christianity, the North American Patristics Society, the International Conference on Patristic Studies, and the Seminar on the Development of Early Catholic Christianity, and the American Society of Church History. Bishop Lists: Formation of Apostolic Succession of Bishops in Ecclesiastical Crises is a revision of his doctoral dissertation in New Testament and Early Christian Literature completed under Robert M. Grant at the University of Chicago."'

S"About the disciple known as Doubting Thomas, everyone knows at least this much: he stuck his finger into the risen Jesus' wounds. Or did he? A fresh look at the Gospel of John reveals how little we may really understand about this most perplexing of biblical figures, and how much we might learn from the strange twists and turns Thomas's story has taken over time. From the New Testament, Glenn W. Most traces Thomas's permutations through the centuries: as Gnostic saint, missionary to India, paragon of Christian orthodoxy, hero of scepticism, and negative example of doubt, blasphemy, stupidity, and violence. Rife with paradoxes and tensions, these creative transformations at the hands of storytellers, theogians, and artists tell us a great deal about the complex relations between texts and their interpretations - and about faith, love, personal identity, the body and twins, among other matters. John, set against the conclusions of the other Gospels, and ends with a detailed analysis of the painting of this subject by Caravaggio, setting it within the pictorial traditions of late antiquity, the Middle Ages, and the Renaissance. Along the way, Most considers narrative reactions to John's account by storytellers of various religious persuasions, and Christian theologians' interpretations of John 20 from the second century AD until the Counter-Reformation. His work shows how Thomas's story, in its many guises, touches upon central questions of religion, philosophy, herteneutics, and, not least, life."

S'"Blessed is He who has brought Adam from Sheol" Christ\'s descent to the dead in the Theology of Saint Ephrem the Syrian is an examination of the theological use of the doctrine of Christ\'s descent to the dead in the works of Saint Ephrem the Syrian (ca. 306-373 C.E.). In the ancient Christian church, it was believed, taught, and confessed that in the interval between his crucifixion and resurrection, Jesus Christ descended to the abode of the dead. Christ\'s descent to the underworld was nowhere earlier, more elaborately, or more influentially expressed than within cultural milieu of Syriac Christianity, where the underworld was designated not as Hades or Inferos, but as Sheol, and it was nowhere within this milieu more frequently, effectively, and influentially implemented than in the writings of Ephrem the Syrian. Organically integrated with and providing an integrating function within his theological reflection as a whole, Ephrem\'s conception of Christ\'s descent to Sheol provides us with an important and distinctive vision of the significance of this salvific event. Ephrem\'s use Semitic and non-Western poetic forms and structures as a mode of theological discourse, coupled with his preference for imagery and symbolism rather than definition, resulted in a variety of vivid depictions of Christ\'s descent to Sheol. Especially informed by Ephrem\'s view of the redemptive and revelatory significance of Christ\'s incarnation, these \'verbal icons\' imaginatively collapsed distinctions between temporality and eternity and creatively drew together cosmological, incarnational, soteriological, ecclesiological, sacramental, and eschatological themes in the context of Christian worship.

S'<i>The Ambassadors</i>, which Henry James considered his best work, is the most exquisite refinement of his favorite theme: the collision of American innocence with European experience. This time, James recounts the continental journey of Louis Lambert Strether--a fiftysomething man of the world who has been dispatched abroad by a rich widow, Mrs. Newsome. His mission: to save her son Chadwick from the clutches of a wicked (i.e., European) woman, and to convince the prodigal to return to Woollett, Massachusetts. Instead, this all-American envoy finds Europe growing on him. Strether also becomes involved in a very Jamesian "relation" with the fascinating Miss Maria Gostrey, a fellow American and informal Sacajawea to her compatriots. Clearly Paris has "improved" Chad beyond recognition, and convincing him to return to the U.S. is going to be a very, very hard sell. Suspense, of course, is hardly James\'s stock-in-trade. But there is no more meticulous mapper of tone and atmosphere, nuance and implication. His hyper-refined characters are at their best in dialogue, particularly when they\'re exchanging morsels of gossip. Astute, funny, and relentlessly intelligent, James amply fulfills his own description of the novelist as a person upon whom nothing is lost. <i>--Rhian Ellis</i>'

S'We live in a world shot through with evil. The twentieth century has witnessed suffering and human cruelty on a scale never before imagined. Yet, paradoxically, in recent years the doctrine of original sin has suffered neglect and ridicule. In this philosophically sophisticated treatment of the biblical evidence for original sin, Henri Blocher offers a robust response. Interacting with the best theological thinking on the subject, this New Studies in Biblical Theology volume shows that while the nature of original sin is a mystery--even a riddle--only belief in it makes sense of evil and wrongdoing. After a general survey of the biblical evidence, Blocher moves on to discuss the two key texts. First, he considers the relation of the Eden story of Genesis 2 and 3 to modern scientific, literary and theological thinking. Then, he offers a new and groundbreaking interpretation of Romans 5, where Paul discusses Christ and Adam. From this exegetical foundation, he goes on to show how the doctrine of original sin makes sense of the paradoxes of human existence. In the final chapter, he discusses the intellectual difficulties that some feel remain with the doctrine itself. Addressing key issues in biblical theology, the works comprising New Studies in Biblical Theology are creative attempts to help Christians better understand their Bibles. The NSBT series is edited by D. A. Carson, aiming to simultaneously instruct and to edify, to interact with current scholarship and to point the way ahead'

Cornell has played a distinctive role in democratizing higher education, while helping to shape the American university\'s post-Civil War commitment to useful service to American society and to the world. The undergraduate experience has been the heart of life on East Hill, \'far above Cayuga\'s Waters.\' Its undergraduates have lived the ideals carved into the Eddy Street gate: \'So enter that daily thou mayest become more learned and thoughtful. So depart that daily thou mayest become more useful to thy country and to mankind.\' It is our privilege and honor to single out and, in most cases, pay tribute to Cornell\'s most distinguished sons and daughters."--from the PrefaceGraduates of Cornell University have achieved remarkable success in all areas from literature and photography to economics and agriculture, from finance and chemistry to athletics and the stage. They have held positions of leadership in boardrooms and classrooms, blazed new paths in medicine and journalism, acted on lofty ideals and strong ambition. Cornellians are regulars in Stockholm, on the bestseller lists, and in high office. Faced with all that excellence, the authors of this book sifted through encyclopedias, archives, and alumni records and engaged in conversations and debates to arrive at a final group of one hundred notable men and women who completed an undergraduate degree program at Cornell. These alumni are representative in their distinction (and, in a few cases, for their notoriety). Each Cornellian is profiled in a witty and erudite essay, each accompanied--with one telling exception--by a portrait. In immortalizing a selection of notable Cornellians from a bit more than the first hundred years of the university, the authors arrive at a portrait of Cornell itself, "a world-class institution with an egalitarian soul" where undergraduates are guided to exceed their own goals and change the world, too.'

S"Robert Rubin was sworn in as the seventieth U.S. Secretary of the Treasury in January 1995 in a brisk ceremony attended only by his wife and a few colleagues. As soon as the ceremony was over, he began an emergency meeting with President Bill Clinton on the financial crisis in Mexico. This was not only a harbinger of things to come during what would prove to be a rocky period in the global economy; it also captured the essence of Rubin himself--short on formality, quick to get into the nitty-gritty.<br /><br />From his early years in the storied arbitrage department at Goldman Sachs to his current position as chairman of the executive committee of Citigroup, Robert Rubin has been a major figure at the center of the American financial system. He was a key player in the longest economic expansion in U.S. history. With <b>In an Uncertain World</b>, Rubin offers a shrewd, keen analysis of some of the most important events in recent American history and presents a clear, consistent approach to thinking about markets and dealing with the new risks of the global economy.<br /><br />Rubin's fundamental philosophy is that nothing is provably certain. Probabilistic thinking has guided his career in both business and government. We see that discipline at work in meetings with President Clinton and Hillary Clinton, Chinese premier Zhu Rongji, Alan Greenspan, Lawrence Summers, Newt Gingrich, Sanford Weill, and the late Daniel Patrick Moynihan. We see Rubin apply it time and again while facing financial crises in Asia, Russia, and Brazil; the federal government shutdown; the rise and fall of the stock market; the challenges of the post-September 11 world; the ongoing struggle over fiscal policy; and many other momentous economic and political events.<br /><br />With a compelling and candid voice and a sharp eye for detail, Rubin portrays the daily life of the White House-confronting matters both mighty and mundane--as astutely as he examines the challenges that lie ahead for the nation. Part political memoir, part prescriptive economic analysis, and part personal look at business problems, <b>In an Uncertain World</b> is a deep examination of Washington and Wall Street by a figure who for three decades has been at the center of both worlds.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>"

A Conflict of Visions offers a convincing case that ethical and policy disputes circle around the disparity between both outlooks.'

Explaining 'economics'_an academic discipline_is not the same thing as explaining 'the economy'_the processes of producing and distributing goods and services. The difference is crucial, because meaningful economic literacy requires the ability to think critically about the distinctive viewpoint proposed by academic economics, a viewpoint that has become dominant in contemporary politics and culture. A combination of economic theory and description is essential for understanding debates about current affairs, reading some professional economics literature, and reflecting on the usefulness and limits of the discipline of economics. These are ambitious goals for a short book, and while the book is serious, it is not grim_thus basic economics with an attitude."

She acquires two admirers of a very different stamp: Olive Chancellor, devotee of radical causes, and marked out for tragedy; and Basil Ransom, veteran of the Civil War, with rigid views concerning society and women's place therein. Is the lovely, lighthearted Verena made for public movements or private passions? A struggle to possess her, body and soul, develops between Olive and Basil. <br />The exploitation of Verena's unregenerate innocence reflects a society whose moral and cultural values are failing to survive the new dawn of liberalism and democracy. The Bostonians (1886) was not welcomed by James's fellow countrymen, who failed to appreciate its delicacy and wit; but a century later, this book is widely regarded as James's finest American fiction, and perhaps his comic masterpiece."

S"Frances Hodgson Burnett, author of The Secret Garden, A Little Princess, and Little Lord Fauntleroy, was one of the most successful and controversial women of her time. Burnett's flamboyant persona and unconventional lifestyle made her a contentious figure in Victorian society, and for generations after her death, her own family refused to acknowledge her. Burnett is best known for her children's literature, but she began her career as a bestselling adult novelist. The themes of Burnett's adult novels were often serious: working women, abusive marriages, and single motherhood, and for many years these novels have been overshadowed by the fame of her children's books. Recently, however, scholars have rediscovered these works and have begun to study and write about them. In 2003 at California State University, Fresno, Angelica Carpenter convened the first conference ever held about this famous author. Scholars, fans, and collectors gathered to contribute to the knowledge on the author and to discuss her accomplishments. The talks ranged from scholarly to conversational, covering Burnett's books for both children and adults, the plays and movies that were made from them, the books they inspired, and the way in which the author's life was reflected in her fiction. In the Garden: Essays in Honor of Frances Hodgson Burnett recreates many of the conference talks, as well as other essays offering practical advice for collectors and the first interview ever published with Burnett's great-granddaughter, who inherited the family archive."

Its dazzling mixture of fantasy and satire is narrated by a personification of Folly, dressed as a jester, who celebrates youth, pleasure, drunkenness and sexual desire, and goes on to lambast human pretensions, foibles and frailties, to mock theologians and monks and to praise the 'folly' of simple Christian piety. Erasmus's wit, wordplay and wisdom made the book an instant success, but it also attracted what may have been sales-boosting criticism.

Its influence was incalculable. It disseminated humanist learning and humanist attitudes among the new reading public to such an extent that it can be claimed as one of the books that contributed most to form the European mind. The adages were proverbs or popular sayings taken from classical literature. Many are part of the common stock of our speech today. A necessary evil, cupboard love, a rare bird, an iron in the fire, are all to be found in the Adagia.

Given that background, it is understandable why Armstrong was able to channel his boundless energy toward athletic endeavors. By his senior year in high school, he was already a professional triathlete and was training with the U.S. Olympic cycling developmental team. In 1993, Armstrong secured a position in the ranks of world-class cyclists by winning the World Championship and a Tour de France stage, but in 1996, he was diagnosed with testicular cancer. Armstrong entered an unknown battlefield and challenged it as if climbing through the Alps: aggressive yet tactical. He beat the cancer and proceeded to stun all the pundits by winning the 1999 Tour de France. In this memoir, Armstrong covers his early years swiftly with a blunt matter-of-factness, but the main focus is on his battle with cancer. Readers will respond to the inspirational recovery story, and they will appreciate the behind-the-scenes cycling information.

S'This intelligent and thought-provoking reading of Aristophanes\' Clouds focuses on logos, or the power of argument, and on the self-awareness of our second Clouds as a comedy of logos directed toward an audience made resistant by devotion to the body. Integrating the comical and philosophical agendas of the play and balancing rhetoric with comedy, O\'Regan explores the Greek view of skillful speech as a kind of force and demonstrates the dramatic and thematic unity with which the Clouds challenges his conception. Discussing the differences between the play\'s first and second versions, O\'Regan shows how the Clouds\' comedy and its self-defined "history" tell the same story: onstage and off, speech is subordinate to human nature and desire. O\'Regan\'s argument conveys much insight into fifth-century thought and the play\'s workings as well as placing the Clouds in the institutional and generic contexts of Athenian drama. Analyzing the role of the audience in the dynamic of the play and the impact of its comedy on the spectators, she argues that the Clouds is civic education, awakening personal reflections and contributing to the contemporary debate about democracy, language, and the city.'

S'From primordial nothingness to this very moment, <i>A Short History of Nearly Everything</i> reports what happened and how humans figured it out. To accomplish this daunting literary task, Bill Bryson uses hundreds of sources, from popular science books to interviews with luminaries in various fields. His aim is to help people like him, who rejected stale school textbooks and dry explanations, to appreciate how we have used science to understand the smallest particles and the unimaginably vast expanses of space. With his distinctive prose style and wit, Bryson succeeds admirably.<br /><br /><p>Though <i>A Short History</i> clocks in at a daunting 500-plus pages and covers the same material as every science book before it, it reads something like a particularly detailed novel (albeit without a plot). Each longish chapter is devoted to a topic like the age of our planet or how cells work, and these chapters are grouped into larger sections such as "The Size of the Earth" and "Life Itself." Bryson chats with experts like Richard Fortey (author of <i>Life</i> and <i>Trilobite</i>) and these interviews are charming. But it\'s when Bryson dives into some of science\'s best and most embarrassing fights--Cope vs. Marsh, Conway Morris vs. Gould--that he finds literary gold. </p><i>--Therese Littleton</i>'

S'Spectator Politics Metatheatre and Performance in Aristophanes Niall W. Slater "<i>Spectator Politics</i> is a rich and imaginatively conceived study of the self-referential nature of Aristophanic comedy which envisions, often in precise detail, the original production of eight comedies in chronological order. . . . A welcome contribution to Aristophanic scholarship: original, well-informed and well-researched and, not the least of its virtues, amusingly written."--<i>Bryn Mawr Classical Review</i> "Superb. . . . A book that should greatly appeal to anyone who is interested in the process of human thought and action. The themes are as pertinent to our world as they were to that of Aristophanes\' audience."--<i>Virginia Quarterly Review</i> "The quality of scholarship is first-rate; it is clearly and engagingly written and is full of fresh insights into a great many facets of Aristophanes\' plays."--Jeffrey Henderson, Boston University "An excellent book, lively, thought-provoking, full of insights--a book that will stimulate discussion for many years."--<i>Scholia Reviews</i> <i>Spectator Politics</i> is the first major study of metatheatre, or theatrically self-conscious performance, in Aristophanes. Using a reception-based performance criticism, Niall Slater elucidates the comic effectiveness of the earliest surviving comedies in the Western tradition. Slater demonstrates that Aristophanes employed metatheatre not simply to entertain but also to teach his audience how to read and interpret performance in other key public venues of the ancient democracy of Athens, such as performances in the political assembly and law courts. Aristophanes was, Slater contends, the first performance critic. <i>Spectator Politics</i> shows how Aristophanes\' comedy served the Athenians by helping them to become active political participants, teaching them to see through deceptive performances, whether on stage or in the political sphere. His comedies use self-conscious performance to encourage the public to move out of the role of passive consumers of spectacle and to reengage the political process. Aristophanes\' critique of performance prefigures much in the performance-dominated culture of the modern American political scene. Throughout, detailed readings of the original stagings illuminate the plays for today\'s audiences and performers, while Slater\'s cultural critique provides much for those interested in Athenian democracy and its lesson for the contemporary political scene. <i>Spectator Politics</i> offers a salutary demonstration of the power of art to expose and resist the performance powers of would-be demagogues. <b>Niall W. Slater</b> is Professor of Classics at Emory University and author of <i>Plautus in Performance: The Theatre of the Mind</i>. 2002 376 pages 6 1/8 x 9 1/4 ISBN 978-0-8122-3652-1 Cloth $75.00s 49.00 World Rights Classics Short copy: "The quality of scholarship is first-rate; it is clearly and engagingly written and is full of fresh insights into a great many facets of Aristophanes\' plays."--Jeffrey Henderson, Boston University"'

George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, the British spy Edward Bancroft, Madame Lafayette and Jefferson\'s Paris "interest" Maria Cosway, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, the scandalmonger James Callender, Sally Hemings, John Marshall, Talleyrand, and Aaron Burr all figure in this panoramic chronicle, as does, importantly, John Quincy Adams, the adored son whom Adams would live to see become President. </p><p> Crucial to the story, as it was to history, is the relationship between Adams and Jefferson, born opposites -- one a Massachusetts farmer\'s son, the other a Virginia aristocrat and slaveholder, one short and stout, the other tall and spare. Adams embraced conflict; Jefferson avoided it. Adams had great humor; Jefferson, very little. But they were alike in their devotion to their country. </p><p> At first they were ardent co-revolutionaries, then fellow diplomats and close friends. With the advent of the two political parties, they became archrivals, even enemies, in the intense struggle for the presidency in 1800, perhaps the most vicious election in history. Then, amazingly, they became friends again, and ultimately, incredibly, they died on the same day -- their day of days -- July 4, in the year 1826. </p><p> Much about John Adams\'s life will come as a surprise to many readers. His courageous voyage on the frigate <i>Boston</i> in the winter of 1778 and his later trek over the Pyrenees are exploits that few would have dared and that few readers will ever forget. </p><p> It is a life encompassing a huge arc -- Adams lived longer than any president. The story ranges from the Boston Massacre to Philadelphia in 1776 to the Versailles of Louis XVI, from Spain to Amsterdam, from the Court of St. James\'s, where Adams was the first American to stand before King George III as a representative of the new nation, to the raw, half-finished Capital by the Potomac, where Adams was the first President to occupy the White House. </p><p> This is history on a grand scale -- a book about politics and war and social issues, but also about human nature, love, religious faith, virtue, ambition, friendship and betrayal, and the far-reaching consequences of noble ideas. Above all, <i>John Adams</i> is an enthralling, often surprising story of one of the most important and fascinating Americans who ever lived.</p>'

p3542
(lp3543
S'"The free press cannot be free," Robert Entman asserts. "Inevitably, it is dependent." In this penetrating critique of American journalism and the political process, Entman identifies a "vicious circle of interdependence" as the key dilemma facing reporters and editors. To become sophisticated citizens, he argues, Americans need high-quality, independent political journalism; yet, to stay in business while producing such journalism, news organizations would need an audience of sophisticated citizens. As Entman shows, there is no easy way out of this dilemma, which has encouraged the decay of democratic citizenship as well as the media\'s continuing failure to live up to their own highest ideals. Addressing widespread despair over the degeneration of presidential campaigns, Entman argues that the media system virtually compels politicians to practice demagoguery.<br /> Entman confronts a provocative array of issues: how the media\'s reliance on elite groups and individuals for information inevitably slants the news, despite adherence to objectivity standards; why the media hold government accountable for its worst errors--such as scandals and foreign misadventures--only after it\'s too late to prevent them; how the interdependence of the media and their audience molds public opinion in ways neither group alone can control; why greater media competition does not necessarily mean better journalism; why the abolition of the FCC\'s Fairness Doctrine could make things worse. Entman sheds fascinating light on important news events of the past decade. He compares, for example, coverage of the failed hostage rescue in 1980, which subjected President Carter to a barrage of criticism, with coverage of the 1983 bombing that killed 241 Marines in Lebanon, an incident in which President Reagan largely escaped blame. He shows how various factors unrelated to the reality of the events themselves--the apparent popularity of Reagan and unpopularity of Carter, differences in the way the Presidents publicly framed the incidents, the potent symbols skillfully manipulated by Reagan\'s but not by Carter\'s news managers--produced two very different kinds of reportage.<br /> Entman concludes with some thoughtful suggestions for improvement. Chiefly, he proposes the creation of subsidized, party-based news outlets as a way of promoting new modes of news gathering and analysis, of spurring the established media to more innovative coverage, and of increasing political awareness and participation. Such suggestions, along with the author\'s probing media criticisms, make this book essential reading for anyone concerned about the state of democracy in America.<br />'

p3546
(lp3547
S'Endlessly pursued but ever elusive, <i>Moby-Dick</i> roams freely throughout the American imagination. A fathomless source for literary exploration, Melville\'s masterpiece has also inspired a stunning array of book illustrations, prints, comics, paintings, sculptures, mixed media, and even architectural designs. Innovative and lavishly illustrated, <i>Unpainted to the Last</i> illuminates this impressive body of work and shows how it opens up our understanding of both <i>Moby-Dick</i> and twentieth-century American art. <br />Deftly interweaving words with images, Elizabeth Schultz radically reframes our most famous literary symbol and provides a profoundly new way of "reading" one of the key texts in American literature. Ranging from the realists to the abstract expressionists, from the famous to the obscure, Schultz reveals how these artists have tried both to capture the essence of Moby-Dick\'s many meanings and to use it as a springboard for their own provocative imaginations. <br />The most continuously, frequently, and diversely illustrated of all American novels, Moby-Dick has attracted some remarkable book illustrators in Rockwell Kent, Boardman Robinson, Garrick Palmer, Barry Moser, and Bill Sienkiewicz, among others represented here. It has also inspired extraordinary creations by such prominent artists as Jackson Pollock, Frank Stella, Sam Francis, Benton Spruance, Leonard Baskin, Theodoros Stamos, Richard Ellis, Ralph Goings, Seymour Lipton, Walter Martin, Tony Rosenthal, Richard Serra, and Theodore Roszak. <br />The artists reflect in equal measure the novel\'s realistic (plot, character, natural history) and philosophical modes, its visual and visionary dimensions. Some, like the obsessed and haunted Gilbert Wilson, claim <i>Moby-Dick</i> as their "Bible." Still others view the novel as a touchstone for feminist, multicultural, and environmentalist themes, or mock its status as a cultural icon. <br />Schultz demonstrates how these and many other diverse talents enlarge our appreciation of <i>Moby-Dick</i> and how literature and art can amplify each other\'s meanings and achievements. Yet ultimately she, like Melville, concludes that the great white whale remains unpainted and unread in any absolute or final sense.'

S"E.M. Forster's <i>Aspects of the Novel </i>is an innovative and effusive treatise on a literary form that, at the time of publication, had only recently begun to enjoy serious academic consideration. This Penguin Classics edition is edited with an introduction by Oliver Stallybrass, and features a new preface by Frank Kermode.<br /><br />First given as a series of lectures at Cambridge University, <i>Aspects of the Novel</i> is Forster's analysis of this great literary form. Here he rejects the 'pseudoscholarship' of historical criticism - 'that great demon of chronology' - that considers writers in terms of the period in which they wrote and instead asks us to imagine the great novelists working together in a single room. He discusses aspects of people, plot, fantasy and rhythm, making illuminating comparisons between novelists such as Proust and James, Dickens and Thackeray, Eliot and Dostoyevsky - the features shared by their books and the ways in which they differ. Written in a wonderfully engaging and conversational manner, this penetrating work of criticism is full of Forster's habitual irreverence, wit and wisdom.<br /><br />In his new introduction, Frank Kermode discusses the ways in which Forster's perspective as a novelist inspired his lectures. This edition also includes the original introduction by Oliver Stallybrass, a chronology, further reading and appendices.<br /><br />E. M. Forster (1879-1970) was a noted English author and critic and a member of the Bloomsbury group. His first novel, <i>Where Angels Fear To Tread</i> appeared in 1905. <i>The Longest Journey</i> appeared in 1907, followed by<i> A Room With A View</i> (1908), based partly on the material from extended holidays in Italy with his mother. <i>Howards End</i> (1910) was a story that centered on an English country house and dealt with the clash between two families, one interested in art and literature, the other only in business. <i>Maurice</i> was revised several times during his life, and finally published posthumously in 1971.<br /><br />If you enjoyed <i>Aspects of the Novel</i>, you might like Forster's <i>A Room with a View</i>, also available in Penguin Classics."

p3558
(lp3559
S'Separated by millennia, Aristotle and Sigmund Freud gave us disparate but compelling pictures of the human condition. But if, with Jonathan Lear, we scrutinize these thinkers\' attempts to explain human behavior in terms of a higher principle--whether happiness or death--the pictures fall apart. Aristotle attempted to ground ethical life in human striving for happiness, yet he didn\'t understand what happiness is any better than we do. Happiness became an enigmatic, always unattainable, means of seducing humankind into living an ethical life. Freud fared no better when he tried to ground human striving, aggression, and destructiveness in the death drive, like Aristotle attributing purpose where none exists. Neither overarching principle can guide or govern "the remainder of life," in which our inherently disruptive unconscious moves in breaks and swerves to affect who and how we are. Lear exposes this tendency to self-disruption for what it is: an opening, an opportunity for new possibilities. His insights have profound consequences not only for analysis but for our understanding of civilization and its discontent.'

The contributors explore the sociopolitical and material contexts of the works discussed and trace the genre into the fourth century, when it underwent profound changes. Simultaneously a study of classical Greek literature and an analysis of cultural production, this collection reveals how for two centuries Athens itself was transformed, staged as comedy, and, ultimately, shaped by contemporary material, social, and ideological forces. <br /><br />The contributors are Elizabeth Bobrick, Gregory Crane, Gregory Dobrov, Malcolm Heath, Jeffrey Henderson, Timothy P.

Then, settling, not flopping, down, he completed his preparations for the journey by raising the sharp crease of the trousers one inch over each knee -- a legendary precaution which in youth is believed to prevent vulgar bagging.

Imprisoned many times, pilloried and reviled by his enemies, through it all he managed to produce some of the most significant literature of the eighteenth century.<br /> Daniel Defoe: Master of Fictions is the first biography to view Defoe's complex life through the angle of vision that is most important to us as modern readers--his career as a writer. Maximillian Novak, a leading authority on Defoe, ranges from the writer's earliest collection of brief stories, which he presented to his future wife under the sobriquet Bellmour, to his Compleat English Gentleman, left unpublished at his death. Novak illuminates such works as Robinson Crusoe and Moll Flanders, novels that changed the course of fiction in their time and have remained towering classics to this day. And he reveals a writer who was a superb observer of his times--an age of dramatic historical, political, and social change. Indeed, through his many pamphlets, newspapers, books of travel, and works of fiction, Defoe commented on everything from birth control to the price of coal, and from flying machines to the dangers of the plague. <br /> Beautifully and authoritatively written, this is the first serious, full-scale biography of Defoe to appear in a decade. It gives us, for the first time, a full understanding of the thought and personal experience that lie behind some of the great works of English literature.<br />"

S"Gustave Flaubert (1821-1880), whose <i>Madame Bovary</i> outraged the right-thinking bourgeoisie when it was first published in 1856, is brought to life here in all his singularity and brilliance. Frederick Brown's insightful portrayal is of an artist fraught with contradictions, his wit and bravado merging into vulnerability. A sedentary man by nature, Flaubert undertook epic voyages through Egypt and the Middle East. He could be flamboyantly uncouth but was fanatically devoted to beautifully cadenced prose. While energized by his camaraderie with male friends, who included Turgenev, the Goncourt brothers, Zola, and Maupassant, he depended upon the emotional nurture of maternal women, notably George Sand. His assorted mistresses--French, Egyptian, and English--fed his richly erotic imagination and found their way into his fictional characters.<br /><br />Flaubert's time and place caused him to be literally put on trial for portraying lewd behavior in <i>Madame Bovary</i>. His milieu also made him a celebrity and, indirectly, brought about his financial ruin, probably hastening his sudden death at the the age of fifty-nine. Although writing was something like torture for him, it preoccupied his mind and dominated his life. He privately dreamed of popular success, which he in fact achieved with <i>Madame Bovary</i>, but adamantly refused to sacrifice to it his ideal of artistic integrity. About Flaubert's life, inner world, times, and legacy, Frederick Brown's magisterial biography is a revelation."

What distinguishes the human mind from the minds of animals, especially those capable of complex behavior? If such animals, for instance, were magically given the power of language, would their communities evolve an intelligence as subtly discriminating as ours? Will robots, once they have been endowed with sensory systems like those that provide us with experience, ever exhibit the particular traits long thought to distinguish the human mind, including the ability to think about thinking? <br /><br />Dennett addresses these questions from an evolutionary perspective. Beginning with the macromolecules of DNA and RNA, the author shows how, step-by-step, animal life moved from the simple ability to respond to frequently recurring environmental conditions to much more powerful ways of beating the odds, ways of using patterns of past experience to predict the future in never-before-encountered situations. <br /><br />Whether talking about robots whose video-camera eyes give us the powerful illusion that 'there is somebody in there' or asking us to consider whether spiders are just tiny robots mindlessly spinning their webs of elegant design, Dennett is a master at finding and posing questions sure to stimulate and even disturb."

No longer is it a goal for all to pursue. Rather postmodernism sees truth as inseparable from culture, psychology, race and gender. Ultimately, truth is what we make it to be. What factors have accelarated this decay of truth? Why are people willing to embrace such a devalued concept? How does this new view compare and contrast with a Christian understanding? While postmodernism contains some truthful insights (despite its attempt to dethrone truth), Douglas Groothuis sees its basic tenets as intellectually flawed and hostile to Christian views. In this spirited presentation of a solid, biblical and logical perspective, Groothuis unveils how truth has come under attack and how it can be defended in the vital areas of theology, apologetics, ethics and the arts.'

The meager facts of his biography have been gleaned from a handful of legal documents. Yet Vermeer's extraordinary paintings of domestic life, with their subtle play of light and texture, have come to define the Dutch golden age. His portrait of the anonymous Girl with a Pearl Earring has exerted a particular fascination for centuries - and it is this magnetic painting that lies at the heart of Tracy Chevalier's second novel of the same title.<br /><i>Girl with a Pearl Earring</i> centers on Vermeer's prosperous Delft household during the 1660s. When Griet, the novel's quietly perceptive heroine, is hired as a servant, turmoil follows. First, the 16-year-old narrator becomes increasingly intimate with her master. Then Vermeer employs her as his assistant--and ultimately has Griet sit for him as a model."

Mocked by the crew on board the Highlander for his weakness and bullied by the vicious and merciless sailor Jackson, Wellington must struggle to endure the long journey from New York to Liverpool. But when he does reach England, he is equally horrified by what he finds there: poverty, desperation and moral corruption. Inspired by Melville's own youthful experiences on board a cargo boat, this is a compelling tale of innocence transformed, through bitter experience, into disillusionment.

But the intervening years have seen extraordinary advances in the technology of observing both the micro- and the macrocosmic worlds. These observations have confirmed many of Professor Hawking's theoretical predictions in the first edition of his book, including the recent discoveries of the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (COBE), which probed back in time to within 300,000 years of the universe's beginning and revealed wrinkles in the fabric of space-time that he had projected. Eager to bring to his original text the new knowledge revealed by these observations, as well as his own recent research, Professor Hawking has prepared a new introduction to the book, written an entirely new chapter on wormholes and time travel, and updated the chapters throughout."

This simple fact leads to the unavoidable conclusion that space and time must be linked together forever as Spacetime. With his second monumental insight, Einstein showed how Spacetime is warped and stretched by the gravity of all objects in the Universe and even punctured by black holes. But such possible twisting of Spacetime allowed a magic not even Einstein could have imagined: time-travel. <br />Theoretical physicist Jim Al-Khalili finally lays science fiction to rest as he opens up Einstein\'s Universe.

Swift suggests in his essay that the impoverished Irish might ease their economic troubles by selling children as food for rich gentlemen and ladies. By doing this he mocks the authority of the British officials. A Modest Proposal is included in many literature programs as an example of early modern western satire. It also serves as an exceptional introduction to the concept and use of argumentative language, lending itself well to secondary and post-secondary essay courses.

Now this master of mystery fiction takes us into the capital's chaotic fourth estate. At the big, aggressive newspaper The Washington Tribune, a young woman has been murdered. And the hunt for her killer is making sensational and lethal headlines. The victim, fresh out of journalism school, hoped to make a splash at the Trib - and then a maintenance man found her in a supply closet, brutally strangled to death. The Trib's journalists are at once horrified and anxious to solve the crime before the cops do, and put this scandal to rest. But the Metropolitan Police Department isn't going to let byline-hungry reporters get in the way of its investigation, and soon enough the journalists and the cops have established warring task forces. Then a second woman is killed, in Franklin Square. Like the first, she was young, attractive, and worked in the media. For veteran Trib reporter Joe Wilcox, whose career is mired in frustration and disappointment, the case strikes close to home. His daughter is a beautiful rising TV news star. As his relationship with a female MPD detective grows more intimate, Joe sees a chance to renew himself as a reporter and as a man. Spearheading the Trib's investigation, he baits a trap for the killer with a secret from his own past. Suddenly Joe is risking his career, his marriage, and even his daughter's life by playing a dangerous game with a possible serial killer, while a police detective is bending rules for the reporter she likes and trusts but may not know as well as she thinks she does. As Joe's daughter finds herself trapped at the heart of a frantic manhunt, the walls come down between family, friendship, ethics, and ambition - and a killer hides in plain sight."

Godin calls this powerful customer-to- customer dialogue the ideavirus, and cheerfully eggs marketers on to create an environment where their ideas can replicate and spread.<br /><br />In lively detail, Godin looks at the ways companies such as PayPal, Hotmail, GeoCities, even Volkswagen have successfully launched ideaviruses. He offers a "recipe" for creating your own ideavirus, identifies the key factors in the successful spread of an ideavirus (powerful sneezers, hives, a clear vector, a smooth, friction-free transmission), and shows how any business, large or small, can use ideavirus marketing to succeed in a world that just doesn\'t want to hear it anymore from the traditional marketers.'

S'How are we able to understand each other in our daily interactions? Through the use of such "folk" concepts as belief, desire, intention, and expectation, Daniel Dennett asserts in this first full-scale presentation of a theory of intentionality that he has been developing for almost twenty years. We adopt a stance, a predictive strategy of interpretation that presupposes the rationality of the people - or other entities - we are hoping to understand and predict.<br /><br />The 10 essays included here represent the vanguard of Dennett\'s thought, push his theories into surprising new territory, and reveal fresh lines of inquiry into fundamental issues in psychology, artificial intelligence, and evolutionary theory as well as traditional issues in the philosophy of mind.<br /><br />"Dennett\'s essays are vivid, witty and admirably provocative-"<br />- P.

S'Blink is about the first two seconds of looking--the decisive glance that knows in an instant. Gladwell, the best-selling author of "The Tipping Point", campaigns for snap judgments and mind reading with a gift for translating research into splendid storytelling. Building his case with scenes from a marriage, heart attack triage, speed dating, choking on the golf course, selling cars, and military maneuvers, he persuades readers to think small and focus on the meaning of "thin slices" of behavior. The key is to rely on our "adaptive unconscious"--a 24/7 mental valet--that provides us with instant and sophisticated information to warn of danger, read a stranger, or react to a new idea. <br />Gladwell includes caveats about leaping to conclusions: marketers can manipulate our first impressions, high arousal moments make us "mind blind," focusing on the wrong cue leaves us vulnerable to "the Warren Harding Effect" (i.e., voting for a handsome but hapless president). In a provocative chapter that exposes the "dark side of blink," he illuminates the failure of rapid cognition in the tragic stakeout and murder of Amadou Diallo in the Bronx. He underlines studies about autism, facial reading and cardio uptick to urge training that enhances high-stakes decision-making. In this brilliant, cage-rattling book, one can only wish for a thicker slice of Gladwell\'s ideas about what Blink Camp might look like. --Barbara Mackoff'

S'How does <i>good</i> spoil, and how can <i>bad</i> be redeemed? In his penetrating novel <i>The Power and the Glory</i>, Graham Greene explores corruption and atonement through a priest and the people he encounters. In the 1930s one Mexican state has outlawed the Church, naming it a source of greed and debauchery. The priests have been rounded up and shot by firing squad--save one, the whisky priest. On the run, and in a blur of alcohol and fear, this outlaw meets a dentist, a banana farmer, and a village woman he knew six years earlier. For a while, he is accompanied by a toothless man--whom he refers to as his Judas and does his best to ditch. Always, an adamant lieutenant is only a few hours behind, determined to liberate his country from the evils of the church.<p> On the verge of reaching a safer region, the whisky priest is repeatedly held back by his vocation, even though he no longer feels fit to perform his rites: "When he was gone it would be as if God in all this space between the sea and the mountains ceased to exist. Wasn\'t it his duty to stay, even if they despised him, even if they were murdered for his sake? even if they were corrupted by his example?"</p><p> As his sins and dangers increase, the broken priest comes to confront the nature of piety and love. Still, when he is granted a reprieve, he feels himself sliding into the old arrogance, slipping it on like the black gloves he used to wear. Greene has drawn this man--and all he encounters--vividly and viscerally. He may have said <i>The Power and the Glory</i> was "written to a thesis," but this brilliant theological thriller has far more mysteries--and troubling ideals--than certainties. <i>--Joannie Kervran Stangeland</i></p>'

This station he filled from 1831 until the moment of his death, while rising to address Congress on February 23, 1848. However, all of these remarkable achievements are secondary to his role as father. Though a busy man, Adams made it his priority to study the Bible and to train his son to love God s Holy Word.

With this two-volume set, The Library of America presents the finest of Wharton\'s achievement in short fiction: 67 stories drawn from the entire span of her writing life, including the novella-length works <i>The Touchstone</i>, <i>Sanctuary</i>, and <i>Bunner Sisters</i>, eight shorter pieces never collected by Wharton, and many stories long out-of-print.<br /><br />Her range of setting and subject matter is dazzling, and her mastery of style consistently sure. Here are all the aspects of Wharton\'s art: her satire, sometimes gentle, sometimes dark and despairing, of upper-class manners; her unblinking recognition of the power of social convention and the limits of passion; her merciless exposure of commercial motivations; her candid exploration of relations between the sexes.<br /><br />The stories range with cosmopolitan ease from her native New York to the salons and summer hotels of Newport, Paris, and the Italian lakes. The depth of her response to World War I is registered in such works as "The Marne." Of particular interest are the remarkable stories, which treat occult and supernatural themes rarely encountered in her novels, such as the classic ghost stories "The Eyes" and "Pomegranate Seed."'

S"Vance Packard's number-one bestsellers - Hidden Persuaders (1957), Status Seekers (1959), and Waste Makers (1960) - taught the generation of Americans that came of age in the late 1950s and early 1960s about the dangers posed by advertising, social climbing, and planned obsolescence. Like Betty Friedan and William H. Whyte, Jr., Packard (1914- ) is a journalist who played an influential role as the largely complacent 1950s gave way to the tumultuous 1960s. He is also one of the first social critics to foster and to benefit from the newly energized social and political consciousness of this period. Raised on a Pennsylvania farm, shaped by the New Deal at home and the rise of fascism abroad, and trained as a journalist, Packard turned to writing nonfiction books when he faced unemployment in 1956. In addition to his three best-known early works, his later books explore many of the forces shaping America, including invasion of privacy, changing sexual mores, the uprooting of families, and the rise of the ultra rich in the Reagan era. The titles of Packard's most famous works have become a part of our everyday vocabulary. Based in part on interviews with Packard, Daniel Horowitz's intellectual biography focuses on the period during which Packard wrote his major works of social criticism. Horowitz also traces the influence of the writer's early family life and education on his thought. Packard's life illuminates the dilemmas of a freelance social critic without inherited wealth or academic affiliation: the tension between making a living and sustaining independence; the problems posed by a dramatically fluctuating royalty income; and the impact of changing relationships with audience,publishers, intellectuals, academics, and new media such as television and the New Journalism. Packard's career also expands our understanding of how one era helped create the next, underscoring how the adversarial 1960s drew on the mass culture of the previous decade."

The author demonstrates that the play performs its function by examining Athenian ideology. By making the didactic function of tragedy the basis of his interpretation, N.T. Croally is able to offer a coherent view on a number of long-standing problems in Euripidean criticism, such as the relation of Euripides to the Sophists."

S"Married six times, all to women named Brenda, Otis Lee Crenshaw's bourbon-fuelled odyssey takes him from the high mountains of East Tennessee to the bottom of the music charts. A man not above faking his own death to sell more records, this is his not quite true story of romance, recidivism, country music, and an unshakeable belief in Marriage at First Sight."

S'<p>Plato, Aristophanes, and the creators of the "Orphic" gold tablets employ the traditional tale of a journey to the realm of the dead to redefine, within the mythic narrative, the boundaries of their societies. Rather than being the relics of a faded ritual tradition or the products of Orphic influence, these myths can only reveal their meanings through this detailed analysis of the specific ways in which each author makes use of the tradition. For these authors, myth is an agonistic discourse; it is neither a kind of sacred dogma nor a mere literary diversion, but rather a f lexible tool that serves a wide variety of uses. The traditional tale of the journey to the underworld in Greek mythology is neither simple nor single, but each telling reveals a perspective on the cosmos, a reflection of the order of this world through the image of the other. <br /><br /><b>Radcliffe G.
